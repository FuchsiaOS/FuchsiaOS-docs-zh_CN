The following updates have been implemented.

### Communication

**Issue**: Some Matter enabled devices fail commissioning with "Thread border router required" error on F8.1 on the Google Home App.  
**Impact**: Commissioning fix was implemented to read borderAgentID from DNS SD TXT in the affected cases.

***

**Issue**: The mDNS service was not asking for missing A/AAAA/TXT records if they were not provided in the response.  
**Impact**: Query fix was implemented to proactively request SRV/TXT/A/AAAA if needed.
