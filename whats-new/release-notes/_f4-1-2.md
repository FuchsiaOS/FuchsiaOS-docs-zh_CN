**Date:** April 6, 2022

**Version:** F4.1.2

The following updates have been implemented:

**Issue:** Premature block recycles (PBR) cause high stress on NAND storage,
which can increase RMA failures.  
**Impact:** The command sequence used for reading data from NAND storage was
altered to reduce premature block recycle RMA failures.

**Issue:** NDM driver suppresses fatal errors which results in FTL operating in
an inconsistent state.  
**Impact:** NDM driver was updated to stop remapping the fatal errors, allowing
FTL to correctly handle them.

**Issue:** Memory corruption vulnerability found in Uboot.  
**Impact:** Vulnerability in memory corruption has been fixed.
