# Explore components

The `ffx component explore` command starts an interactive shell that lets you explore
the internals of Fuchsia components running on a target device.

## Concepts

The `ffx component explore` command launches a [Dash][dash]{:.external}  process scoped
to the target component. Using this Dash process, you can:

+   Use familiar POSIX commands such as `ls`, `cat` and `grep`.
+   Explore the component's incoming and outgoing capabilities.

Dash is the command interpreter previously used in other tools in the Fuchsia project,
such as `fx shell`, serial console, terminal windows, and `virtcon`. Dash provides
`ffx component explore` a familiar experience to developers, such as `cd` and `ls`, for
navigating spaces in a Fuchsia component, for example:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
[host]$ ffx component explore /bootstrap/archivist
Moniker: /bootstrap/archivist
$ {{ '<strong>' }}ls{{ '</strong>' }}
exposed
ns
out
runtime
svc
$
```

Note: The filesystem used in Dash is not POSIX-compliant. Capabilities are
presented as files and directories to aid in navigation.

However, unlike [`fx shell`][fx-shell], the namespace only contains the component's incoming
and outgoing capabilities. This restriction means you can explore in an environment almost
identical to what the component sees.

## Explore a component {:#explore-a-component}

To connect to a Fuchsia component and start an interactive shell, run the following command:

```posix-terminal
ffx component explore {{ '<var>' }}COMPONENT_IDENTIFIER{{ '</var>' }}
```

Replace <var>COMPONENT_IDENTIFIER</var> with the [moniker][component-moniker],
[URL][component-url], or [instance ID][instance-id] of your target component. The command
also accepts a unique partial match on these identifiers.

The example command below starts an interactive shell (`$`) for exploring the
`/bootstrap/archivst` component:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
[host]$ ffx component explore /bootstrap/archivist
Moniker: /bootstrap/archivist
$
```

In all examples in this guide, the shell prompt from the host machine's terminal is
represented as `[host]$` while the prompt from the component's interactive shell is
represented as `$` alone, without the `[host]` prefix. To put it differently,
`[host]$` means that the command is run on the host machine's terminal while `$`
means the command is run on the interactive shell connected to the target component.

This guide also uses `/bootstrap/archivist` (which is a moniker) for the target component
in most examples. In practice, this argument should be replaced with the component identifier
of your target component.

## Explore capabilities available to a component {:#explore-capabilities-available-to-a-component}

To explore the capabilities of the target component, navigate to the `/ns` directory
in the component's interactive shell. The `/ns` directory contains the component's
namespace, exactly as the component would see it, for example:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
[host]$ ffx component explore /bootstrap/archivist
Moniker: /bootstrap/archivist
$ {{ '<strong>' }}cd ns{{ '</strong>' }}
$ {{ '<strong>' }}ls{{ '</strong>' }}
config
events
pkg
svc
```

If you want the shell's namespace to match the component namespace,
use the `-l` (or `--layout`) flag, for example:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
[host]$ ffx component explore /bootstrap/archivist -l namespace
Moniker: /bootstrap/archivist
$ {{ '<strong>' }}ls{{ '</strong>' }}
config
events
pkg
svc
```

For more details on these directories, see
[What is the namespace root in ffx component explore?](#what-is-the-namespace-root-in-ffx-component-explore).

## Explore capabilities exposed by a component {:#explore-capabilities-exposed-by-a-component}

The `/exposed` directory contains the capabilities exposed from your target
component to its parent, for example:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
[host]$ ffx component explore /bootstrap/archivist
Moniker: /bootstrap/archivist
$ {{ '<strong>' }}cd exposed{{ '</strong>' }}
$ {{ '<strong>' }}ls{{ '</strong>' }}
diagnostics
fuchsia.diagnostics.ArchiveAccessor
fuchsia.diagnostics.FeedbackArchiveAccessor
fuchsia.diagnostics.LegacyMetricsArchiveAccessor
fuchsia.diagnostics.LoWPANArchiveAccessor
fuchsia.diagnostics.LogSettings
fuchsia.logger.Log
fuchsia.logger.LogSink
```

## Explore capabilities served by a component {:#explore-capabilities-served-by-a-component}

If the target component is running on the device, the `/out` directory
contains all the capabilities currently served by the component, for
example:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
[host]$ ffx component explore /bootstrap/archivist
Moniker: /bootstrap/archivist
$ {{ '<strong>' }}cd out{{ '</strong>' }}
$ {{ '<strong>' }}ls{{ '</strong>' }}
diagnostics
svc
$ {{ '<strong>' }}cd svc{{ '</strong>' }}
$ {{ '<strong>' }}ls{{ '</strong>' }}
fuchsia.diagnostics.ArchiveAccessor
fuchsia.diagnostics.FeedbackArchiveAccessor
fuchsia.diagnostics.LegacyMetricsArchiveAccessor
fuchsia.diagnostics.LoWPANArchiveAccessor
fuchsia.diagnostics.LogSettings
fuchsia.logger.Log
```

## Explore debug runtime data of a component {:#explore-debug-runtime-data-of-a-component}

If the target component is running on the device, the `/runtime` directory
contains debug information provided by the component runner, for example:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
[host]$ ffx component explore /bootstrap/archivist
Moniker: /bootstrap/archivist
$ {{ '<strong>' }}cd runtime/elf{{ '</strong>' }}
$ {{ '<strong>' }}ls{{ '</strong>' }}
job_id
process_id
process_start_time
$ {{ '<strong>' }}cat process_id{{ '</strong>' }}
2542
```

## Use a custom command-line tool in the component's shell {:#use-a-custom-command-line-tool-in-the-components-shell}

To add custom command-line tools into the target component's shell environment, use
the `--tools` flag to provide the URLs of tools packages to the `ffx component explore`
command, for example:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
[host]$ ffx component explore /core/network --tools fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/net-cli
Moniker: /core/network
$ {{ '<strong>' }}net help{{ '</strong>' }}
Usage: net <command> [<args>]

commands for net-cli

Options:
  --help            display usage information

Commands:
  filter            commands for packet filter
  if                commands for network interfaces
  log               commands for logging
  neigh             commands for neighbor tables
  route             commands for routing tables
  dhcp              commands for an interfaces dhcp client
  dhcpd             commands to control a dhcp server
  dns               commands to control the dns resolver
```

## Run a command on the component's shell non-interactively {:#run-a-command-on-the-components-shell-non-interactively}

To run a command in the component's on-device shell non-interactively and receive
`stdout`, `stderr`, and exit code, use the `-c` (or `--command`) flag, for example:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
[host]$ ffx component explore /bootstrap/archivist -c "cat /runtime/elf/process_id"
Moniker: /bootstrap/archivist
2542
```

## Appendices

### Why can't I see child components from the parent? {:#why-cant-i-see-child-components-from-the-parent}

Fuchsia does not allow accessing child components directly from the parent.
Previously, using knowledge of the component topology to access a child component's
capabilities made tools brittle in `fx shell`, and in other tools that used to keep
hard-coded paths to `/hub-v2` which encoded knowledge about the system topology.

Instead, the following alternatives are recommended:

-  Route capabilities explicitly from the child to the parent component.
-  Explore the child component itself.

### How is this different from ffx component run? {:#how-is-his-different-from-ffx-component-run}

The [`ffx component run`][ffx-component-run] command creates and starts a component
in a specified collection within the component topology. However, `ffx component run`
offers no interactive capabilities. On the other hand, `ffx component explore` allows
exploring any existing component in the topology interactively. In summary, you can use
`ffx component explore` to learn about a component you just created using
`ffx component run`.

### What is the namespace root in ffx component explore? {:#what-is-the-namespace-root-in-ffx-component-explore}

By default, the `ffx component explore` command creates a virtual file system at the
namespace root (`/`) that contains the following directories:

| Directory  | Description                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/.dash`   | Contains binaries needed by Dash.                           |
| `/exposed` | Contains all exposed capabilities.                            |
| `/ns`      | Contains the component's namespace, exactly as your component |
:            : would see it.                                                 :
| `/svc`     | Contains capabilities needed by Dash.                       |

If the target component is running on the device, the following directories are also
present:

Directory  | Description
---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------
`/out`     | Contains all capabilities currently being served by the component.
`/runtime` | Contains debug information served by the componentâ€™s runner.

If the `--layout namespace` flag is set in `ffx component explore`, the shell's
namespace will match the component's namespace.
