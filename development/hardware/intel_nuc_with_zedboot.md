# Install Fuchsia on a NUC using Zedboot (Legacy)

This guide provides instructions on how to install Fuchsia on an
Intel [NUC][nuc-wiki]{:.external} (Next Unit of Computing) device
using a [Zedboot][glossary.zedboot]-based bootable USB drive.

Caution: This legacy installation method is being deprecated
in favor of the [`mkinstaller` command][install-fuchsia].

The steps are:

1. [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).
1. [Build Fuchsia](#build-fuchsia).
1. [Prepare a Zedboot-based bootable USB drive](#prepare-zedboot-usb).
1. [Enable EFI booting on the NUC](#enable-efi-booting).
1. [Install Fuchsia on the NUC](#install-fuchsia).

## 1. Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before you start installing Fuchsia on a NUC device, make sure that
you've completed the following tasks:

* [Set up the Fuchsia development environment](#set-up-fuchsia-env)
* [Get parts](#get-parts)

### Set up the Fuchsia development environment {#set-up-fuchsia-env}

To set up the Fuchsia development environment on your workstation,
complete the [Get started with Fuchsia][get-started-with-fuchsia] guide.

### Get parts {#get-parts}

Note: Fuchsia only supports the NUC configurations listed in
[Supported system configurations][supported-sys-config]. However,
unsupported NUC configurations may also work with Fuchsia. For more information
on experimental setups, see [Experimental hardware][experimental-hardware].

The following parts are required for this guide:

*  A NUC device (see [example models](#supported-nuc-models))
*  A USB 3.0 flash drive
*  A keyboard
*  A mouse (Optional)
*  A monitor with an HDMI port
*  An HDMI cable
*  An Ethernet cable
*  A Phillips-head screwdriver (with a magnetic tip)

Note: The [_2. Build Fuchsia_](#build-fuchsia) and
[_3. Prepare a USB drive_](#prepare-usb) sections do not require a NUC
device, so you can complete these sections prior to obtaining a NUC device.
However, you will need a USB flash drive for the _3. Prepare a USB drive_
section.

## 2. Build Fuchsia {#build-fuchsia}

Installing Fuchsia on a NUC device requires that you build a Workstation
image (`workstation_eng.x64`) and generate build artifacts on your workstation.

To build Fuchsia for NUC installation, do the following:

1.  Set your build configuration to `workstation_eng.x64`:

    ```posix-terminal
    fx set workstation_eng.x64
    ```

1.  Build Fuchsia:

    ```posix-terminal
    fx build
    ```

    Building Fuchsia can take up to 90 minutes.

## 3. Prepare a Zedboot-based bootable USB drive {#prepare-zedboot-usb}

You need to prepare a bootable USB drive that is based on Fuchsia's
Zedboot. Later in the [Install Fuchsia on the NUC](#install-fuchsia) section,
you will use this USB drive to boot your NUC into the Zedboot mode.

Note: The instructions below require that you've completed the
build in the previous [Build Fuchsia](#build-fuchsia) section.

To prepare a bootable USB drive, do the following:

1. Plug the USB drive into **your workstation**.

1. Identify the path to the USB drive:

   ```posix-terminal
   fx list-usb-disks
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ fx list-usb-disks
   /dev/sda - My Example USB Disk
   ```

1. Create a Zedboot-based bootable USB drive:

   ```posix-terminal
   fx mkzedboot {{ "<var>" }}PATH_TO_USB_DRIVE{{ "</var>" }}
   ```

   Replace `PATH_TO_USB_DRIVE` with the path to the USB drive from the step
   above, for example:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ fx mkzedboot /dev/sda
   ```

   This command creates a Zedboot-based bootable USB drive and
   dismounts the USB drive.

1. Unplug the USB drive from the workstation.

## 4. Enable EFI booting on the NUC {#enable-efi-booting}

Update your NUC's BIOS setup so that it can boot from
a USB drive.

Two versions of BIOS are available on NUC devices: **Visual BIOS** (for instance, NUC7)
and **Aptio V BIOS** (for instance, NUC11). The steps are slightly different depending
on which BIOS is included in your system.

Important: To be able to enter the BIOS setup mode, you may need to unplug the
Ethernet cable from the NUC device if it's already connected to the host machine.

* {Visual BIOS}

   1. To save and exit BIOS, press `F10` and click **Ok**.

## 5. Install Fuchsia on the NUC {#install-fuchsia}

Use the [Zedboot-based bootable USB drive](#prepare-zedboot-usb) to boot
your NUC into the Zedboot mode. Then pave the
[Workstation prebuilt image](#build-fuchsia) from your workstation
to the NUC to install Fuchsia for the first time.

On a NUC, Fuchsia boots the device using a chain of bootloaders. The instructions
in this section creates a bootable USB drive for Fuchsia that handles the first two
steps in the bootloader chain: [Gigaboot][gigaboot] and [Zedboot][glossary.zedboot].
Gigaboot is a UEFI boot shim with some limited functionality (for instance,
[netbooting][netbooting] and flashing). By default, Gigaboot chains into Zedboot,
which is a bootloader built on top of Zircon. Zedboot then can boot the device
into a Fuchsia product or allow you to pave a Fuchsia image to the device.

To install Fuchsia on your NUC, do the following:

1. Plug the Zedboot-based bootable USB drive into the NUC.

1. Connect the NUC directly to the workstation using an Ethernet cable
   (or connect the NUC to a router or WiFi modem in the same
   Local Area Network as the workstation).

   Note: Network booting only works with the NUC's built-in Ethernet port â€“
   netbooting with an USB port (via an Ethernet-to-USB adapter) is not supported.

1. Reboot your NUC.

   The NUC boots into Fuchsia's Zedboot mode, displaying Zedboot's signature
   blue screen.

1. On the Zedboot screen, press `Alt` + `F3` to switch to a command-line prompt.

   Note: If you cannot press `Alt`+`F3` because the keyboard on the NUC is not
   working, see
   [Keyboard not working after Zedboot](#keyboard-not-working-after-zedboot)
   in Troubleshoot.

1. On the NUC, view the HDD or SSD's block device path:

   ```posix-terminal
   lsblk
   ```

   Take note of the block device path (for example, the path might look like
   `/dev/sys/platform/pci/00:17.0/ahci/sata0/block`).

1. On the NUC, wipe and initialize the partition tables of the NUC:

   ```posix-terminal
   install-disk-image wipe-partition-tables --block-device <BLOCK_DEVICE_PATH>
   ```

   ```posix-terminal
   install-disk-image init-partition-tables --block-device <BLOCK_DEVICE_PATH>
   ```

   Replace `BLOCK_DEVICE_PATH` with the block device path from the step above,
   for example:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ install-disk-image wipe-partition-tables --block-device /dev/sys/platform/pci/00:17.0/ahci/sata0/block
   $ install-disk-image init-partition-tables --block-device /dev/sys/platform/pci/00:17.0/ahci/sata0/block
   ```

1. **On your workstation**, pave the Fuchsia image to the NUC:

   ```posix-terminal
   fx pave
   ```

1. When the paving is finished, unplug the USB drive from the NUC.

Fuchsia is now installed on your NUC. When you reboot the device, it will load Gigaboot,
Zedboot, and Fuchsia all from your device's storage. Therefore, you no longer need to
keep the USB drive plugged in.

Later, if you need to install a new version of Fuchsia (for instance, after re-building
a new Workstation image using `fx build`), see
[Flash a new Fuchsia image to the NUC][flash-fuchsia-to-nuc].

## Troubleshoot

### Keyboard not working after Zedboot {#keyboard-not-working-after-zedboot}

After plugging the Zedboot USB drive to the NUC,
if you notice that the keyboard on the NUC is not working, then skip
Step 4 through 6 and perform the following workaround instead:

1. **On your workstation**, try to install Fuchsia on the NUC:

   ```posix-terminal
   fx pave
   ```

   This command may fail due to the partition tables issue on the NUC.

1. View the kernel logs:

   ```posix-terminal
   fx klog
   ```

   In the logs, look for an error message similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   Unable to find a valid GPT on this device with the expected partitions. Please run *one* of the following command(s):
   fx init-partition-tables /dev/sys/platform/pci/00:17.0/ahci/sata0/block
   ```
1. To initialize the partition tables on the NUC, run the suggested command
   in the logs, for example:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ fx init-partition-tables /dev/sys/platform/pci/00:17.0/ahci/sata0/block
   ```

1. Now, to install Fuchsia on the NUC, run the following command again:

   ```posix-terminal
   fx pave
   ```

### Paving or netbooting not working after Zedboot {#paving-not-working-after-zedboot}

After issuing the `fx pave` command, if paving does not complete,
make sure the Ethernet cable is directly connected to the Ethernet port of the NUC, and
is not using an Ethernet-to-USB adapter to connect to a USB port of the NUC â€“
even though an Ethernet-to-USB adapter works after Fuchsia has been paved
(for instance, when doing `fx ota`), the USB port doesn't work with Zedboot when paving.

### Address already in use {#address-already-in-use}

When you run the `fx pave` command, you may run into the following error:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
2022-01-20 15:23:00 [bootserver] cannot bind to [::]:33331 48: Address already in use
there may be another bootserver running
```

When you see this error, do the following:

1. Check the processes that are currently using the port 33331:

   ```posix-terminal
   sudo lsof -i:33331
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ sudo lsof -i:33331
   COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
   ffx     69264 alice  15u  IPv6 0xb12345ed61b7e12d      0t0  UDP *:diamondport
   ```

1. Terminate all the processes in the list, for example:

   ```posix-terminal
   kill 69264
   ```

### Install RAM and SSD to a NUC device {#install-ram-and-ssd-to-nuc}

Some NUC devices do not come with RAM or an SSD. In which case,
you need to install them manually.

<img width="40%" src="/docs/images/developing_on_nuc/parts.jpg"/>

**Figure 1**. A NUC device and RAM and SSD sticks.

The table below shows some RAM and SSD example models:

| Item | Link | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ------ |
| RAM | [Crucial 8GB DDR4-2400 SODIMM][ram-01]{:.external} | Works fine. |

To install the RAM and SSD on your NUC, do the following:

1. Remove the Phillips screws on the bottom feet of the NUC.

   <img width="40%" src="/docs/images/developing_on_nuc/nuc_bottom.jpg"/>
   <img width="40%" src="/docs/images/developing_on_nuc/nuc_inside.jpg"/>

1. Install the RAM.
1. Remove the Phillips screws that would hold the SSD in place
   (a Phillips screwdriver with a magnetic tip is useful here).

1. Install the SSD.
1. Mount the SSD in place using the screws from Step 3.

   <img width="40%" src="/docs/images/developing_on_nuc/parts_installed.jpg"/>
1. Put the bottom feet and screws back in.
1. Plug the power, monitor (using HDMI), and keyboard into the NUC.

### Remote management of NUC devices {:#remote-management-of-nuc-devices}

To enable remote management, including KVM, you need to configure
Intel [AMT][amt]{:.external} (Active Management Technology).

Note: This assumes you're using NUC connected to the EdgeRouter. If
your networking setup is different, you may need a different network
configuration.

First, configure Intel ME on your NUC:

1. Reboot your NUC.
1. Enter Intel ME settings by pressing `Ctrl+P` on the boot screen.
1. Select **MEBx Login**
1. Set up a new password, the default one is `admin`.

   Note: The password must be at least 8 characters long, contain both lowercase and
   uppercase characters, at least one digit and at least one non alphanumeric
   character ("_" is considered alphanumeric).

   Tip: If you choose a password that is exactly 8 characters long, you can use the same password
   as the VNC password below.

1. Configure network:

   1. Select **Intel(R) AMT Configuration**.
   1. Unconfigure existing network settings:

      1. Select **Unconfigure Network Access**
      1. Select **Full Unprovision**
      1. Press `Y` to confirm.
   1. Select **Network Setup** > **TCP/IP Settings** > **Wired LAN IPV4 Configuration**.
   1. Set **DHCP Mode** to **Disabled**.
   1. Set **IPV4 Address** to an address reachable from your host machine via the EdgeRouter.

      On your host machine, run `ifconfig` and find the entry that corresponds to the EdgeRouter, for example:

      ``` none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
      $ ifconfig
      enx00e04c0c13ba: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
              inet 192.168.42.86  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.42.255
              ...
      ```

      In this case, you could try using the address **192.168.42.20**

   1. Set **Subnet Mask Address** to the netmask of your host machine to EdgeRouter connection, for example **255.255.255.0**.
   1. Press `Esc` until you return to **Intel(R) AMT Configuration**.
   1. Select **Activate Network Access** and press `Y` to confirm.
   1. Exit Intel ME settings and save your changes.

Now, configure the [`amtctrl`][amtctrl]{:.external} command-line utility on your host machine:

These instructions assume you have set some environment variables:

 * `AMT_HOST`: The IPv4 address you configured in the Intel ME settings.
 * `AMT_PASSWORD`: The password you chose for Intel ME.
 * `VNC_PASSWORD`: A password for accessing the NUC over VNC.

Note: The password used for `VNC_PASSWORD` must be _exactly_ 8 characters long,
must contain both lowercase and uppercase characters, at least one digit and
at least one non alphanumeric character.

1. Clone the `amtctrl` repository:

   ```posix-terminal
   git clone https://github.com/sdague/amt
   ```

1. Install `amtctrl`:

   ```posix-terminal
   cd amt && sudo ./setup.py install
   ```

1. Configure NUC IP address and passwords:

   ```posix-terminal
   amtctrl set -V $VNC_PASSWORD nuc $AMT_HOST $AMT_PASSWORD
   ```

1. Enable VNC:

   ```posix-terminal
   amtctrl nuc vnc
   ```

Now, you can access the NUC from your host machine using any VNC client by connecting to
the IP address set in `AMT_HOST`. Enter the password set in `VNC_PASSWORD` when prompted.

Note: The NUC needs to be plugged in to a monitor with a HDMI cable to accept VNC connections.

You can also turn on, turn off or reboot the NUC with the following terminal commands:

 * To turn on the NUC:

   ```posix-terminal
   amtctrl nuc on
   ```

 * To turn off the NUC:

   ```posix-terminal
   amtctrl nuc off
   ```

 * To reboot the NUC:

   ```posix-terminal
   amtctrl nuc reboot
   ```
