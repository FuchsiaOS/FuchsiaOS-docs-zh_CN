# How to write a display driver

Caution: This page may contain information that is specific to the legacy
version of the driver framework (DFv1). Also the workflows documented on
this page may only be specific to the Fuchsia source checkout
(`fuchsia.git`) environment.

So you've decided to bring up a new board. Before you dive into coding, ensure
that you have everything you need by answering these questions:

 * How will I understand how the device and its registers work?

   * This is usually called a "theory of operation". Manufacturers often provide
     datasheets with register definitions, but those references may not explain
     how the device is used in practice.

 * Is there an existing driver for a similar board?

   * Where practical, reuse code for similar boards by refactoring that code and
     amending the bind rules for the driver.

 * Does the device have a fixed display?

   * Some display controllers and panels (output screens) are tightly coupled.
     If this is the case for a new board, you'll need to add support for the
     GPIO, I2C, and other controls as part of the display driver.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you are familiar with driver development for one or more
operating systems. It also assumes that you are familiar with the [Fuchsia
DDK-TL][ddk-tl].

## Programming Languages {#programming-languages}

New drivers must be written in C++. Rust support is planned, but is still highly
experimental.

If an [appropriately licensed][license-policies] driver already exists and is
written in C, it may be acceptable to port it to Fuchsia rather than
implementing a new version in C++. Please contact <graphics-dev@fuchsia.dev>
before making this decision.

## Getting Started {#getting-started}

For platforms without ACPI or a PCI bus, [Modifying board
drivers](board_driver_changes.md) is the first step. This guide assumes that the
board driver is ready and that the display driver is codenamed `fancy`. All code
for the new driver will live in `src/graphics/display/drivers/fancy-display/`.

To begin, create:

 * A minimal implementation of [DisplayControllerImpl][dcimpl]
 * A set of [bind rules][driver-binding]
 * A build recipe for the `DisplayControllerImpl` and the bind rules

### Add the driver to the build {#adding-to-build}

1. Create the build recipe in a file named `BUILD.gn`

```python
# Copyright 2021 The Fuchsia Authors. All rights reserved.
# Use of this source code is governed by a BSD-style license that can be
# found in the LICENSE file.

import("//build/bind/bind.gni")
import("//build/drivers.gni")

driver_bind_rules("fancy-display-bind") {
  rules = "fancy-display.bind"
  header_output = "fancy-display-bind.h"
  bind_output = "fancy-display.bindbc"
  tests = "bind_tests.json"
  deps = [
    "//src/devices/bind/board_maker_company.platform",
  ]
}

# Factored out so that it can be used in tests.
source_set("common") {
  public_deps = [
    ":fancy-display-bind",
  ]
  sources = [
    "fancy-display.cc",
  ]
}

fuchsia_driver("fancy-display") {
  sources = []
  deps = [
    ":common",
    "//src/devices/lib/driver",
  ]
}
```

1. Add `//src/graphics/display/drivers/fancy-display` as a dependency for the
board(s) that you are using as test products. For example, if your device is
part of a [Khadas VIM3 board][vim3-board], modify `//boards/vim3.gni` by adding
your driver to the `_common_bootfs_deps` list.

<!-- TODO: describe this in more detail, including how to build the `core` image
for those products. -->

### Choose devices to drive

Now that you have a build recipe, you can move on to creating the [bind
rules][driver-binding], which the driver manager uses to decide whether a driver
can be used with a device.

1. In `src/graphics/display/drivers/fancy-display`, create `fancy-display.bind`:

```
// Copyright 2021 The Fuchsia Authors. All rights reserved.
// Use of this source code is governed by a BSD-style license that can be
// found in the LICENSE file.

using fuchsia.pci;

fuchsia.BIND_PROTOCOL == fuchsia.pci.BIND_PROTOCOL.DEVICE;
fuchsia.BIND_PCI_VID == fuchsia.pci.BIND_PCI_VID.PLANK_HW_INC;
accept fuchsia.BIND_PCI_DID {
  // Fancy
  0x0100,
  // Fancy+ series
  0x0120,
  0x0121,
}
```

For PC devices, the [intel-i915 bind rules][intel-bind] are a good example. For
fixed-hardware SoCs, see the [Amlogic display rules][amlogic-display-bind].


#### Minimal driver

Finally, add a bare bones driver that simply constructs a new object every
time it successfully binds to a device. Later, you can use the datasheet to get
the device to actually do something.

In `src/graphics/display/drivers/fancy-display`, create `fancy-display.cc`:

```c++
#include <ddktl/device.h>
#include <fuchsia/hardware/display/controller/cpp/banjo.h>

namespace fancy_display {

class Device;
using DeviceType = ddk::Device<Device>

// A Device exposes a single display controller for use by the core display
// driver in src/graphics/display/drivers/display.
//
// This object is constructed once for each device that matches this
// driver's bind rules.
class Device : public DeviceType {
 public:
  explicit Device(zx_device_t* parent) : DeviceType(parent) {}

  // If Bind() returns an error, the driver won't claim the device.
  zx_status_t Bind() { return ZX_OK };

  // Functionality needed by the common display driver core.
  void DisplayControllerImplSetDisplayControllerInterface(
      const display_controller_interface_protocol* interface) {}

  zx_status_t DisplayControllerImplImportBufferCollection(
      uint64_t collection_id, zx::channel collection_token) {
    return ZX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED;
  }

  zx_status_t DisplayControllerImplReleaseBufferCollection(
      uint64_t collection_id) {
    return ZX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED;
  }

  zx_status_t DisplayControllerImplImportImage(
      image_t* image, uint64_t collection_id, uint32_t index) {
    return ZX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED;
  }

  void DisplayControllerImplReleaseImage(image_t* image) {}

  config_check_result_t DisplayControllerImplCheckConfiguration(
      const display_config_t** display_config, size_t display_count,
      uint32_t** layer_cfg_result, size_t* layer_cfg_result_count) {}

  void DisplayControllerImplApplyConfiguration(
      const display_config_t** display_config, size_t display_count) {}

  void DisplayControllerImplSetEld(
      uint64_t display_id,
      const uint8_t* raw_eld_list,
      size_t raw_eld_count) {}

  zx_status_t DisplayControllerImplGetSysmemConnection(
      zx::channel connection) {
    return ZX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED;
  }

  zx_status_t DisplayControllerImplSetBufferCollectionConstraints(
      const image_t* config, uint64_t collection_id) {
    return ZX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED;
  }

};

}  // namespace fancy_display

// Main bind function called from dev manager.
zx_status_t fancy_display_bind(void* ctx, zx_device_t* parent) {
    fbl::AllocChecker alloc_checker;
    auto dev = fbl::make_unique_checked<fancy_display::Device>(
        &alloc_checker, parent);
    if (!alloc_checker.check()) {
        return ZX_ERR_NO_MEMORY;
    }
    auto status = dev->Bind();
    if (status == ZX_OK) {
      // The driver/device manager now owns this memory.
      [[maybe_unused]] auto ptr = dev.release();
    }
    return status;
}

// zx_driver_ops_t is the ABI between driver modules and the device manager.
// This lambda is used so that drivers can be rebuilt without compiler
// warnings if/when new fields are added to the struct.
static zx_driver_ops_t fancy_display_ops = [](){
    zx_driver_ops_t ops;
    ops.version = DRIVER_OPS_VERSION;
    ops.bind = fancy_display_bind;
    return ops;
}();

// ZIRCON_DRIVER marks the compiled driver as compatible with the zircon
// 0.1 driver ABI.
ZIRCON_DRIVER(fancy_display, fancy_display_ops, "zircon", "0.1");
```

Display drivers are required to implement the `DisplayControllerImpl`
[protocol][dcimpl], which exposes hardware layers and implements vsync
notifications. A shared [display-core][display-core] driver wraps all the
device-specific drivers on the system and handles client multiplexing, resource
tracking, fences, etc.

### Implementation tips

The driver decides when and how a configuration passed to `ApplyConfiguration`
takes effect. In order to avoid [tearing][tearing]{: .external}, drivers should
apply new settings just after vsync.

Most devices generate interrupts for vsync events. The easiest way to
ensure timely vsync notifications is to spawn a separate thread just for
servicing that interrupt. *Even if no images are displayed*, your driver must
call `OnDisplayVsync` for every vsync.

#### Controllers with bootloader support

If the display is active on boot, e.g. a panel is turned on and an image is
displayed, then you can get basic functionality in your driver quickly. Read
bootloader logs and/or source to find:

 * The physical address of the framebuffer
 * The registers used to program that address
 * The pixel dimensions of the image, e.g. 800x600
 * The pixel format of the image, e.g. RGB888, NV12, or BGRA8888

Then:

 1. Modify the driver to report a display with the format constraints.
 2. Record the physical address of any imported image in `image->handle`.
 3. When `ApplyConfig` is called, re-program the registers.

If you do not yet know how to observe vsyncs, you can fake it with a thread that
calls `OnDisplayVsync` at 60Hz.

#### Controllers that boot "dark"

There is no one right way to bring up a display controller that lacks even a
basic bootloader driver. In most cases, your roadmap will be:

 1. Power up the device.
 2. Initialize clocks.
 3. Discover attached displays.
 4. Program PHYs for a compatible mode.
 5. Program layouts (framebuffer addrs, etc.) on vsync to avoid [tearing][tearing]{: .external}.
 6. Integrate with [Sysmem][sysmem].
