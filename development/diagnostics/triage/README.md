# Diagnostics Triage Overview

Triage is a library and infrastructure which supports several tools and
services to analyze Diagnostics data on-device and off-device.

Triage-lib analysis is [configured] via json5 config files.

Triage runs off-device on the [command line].

Triage is used by the [Detect] program on-device to file snapshots when needed.

There's a [codelab] to get started.

[configured]: config.md
[command line]: fx_triage.md
[Detect]: /development/diagnostics/analytics/detect.md
[codelab]: codelab.md
