Fuzzing or fuzz testing is style of testing that stochastically generates inputs to targeted
interfaces in order to automatically find defects and/or vulnerabilities.

 * [What to do with bugs and other results produced by fuzzing](handle-results.md)
 * [How to improve your fuzzer](improve-a-fuzzer.md)
