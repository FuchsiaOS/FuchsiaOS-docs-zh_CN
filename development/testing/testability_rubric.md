# Fuchsia Testability Rubrics

## Goals

### Goals of this document

Fuchsia Testability is a form of Readability that focuses on ensuring that
changes to Fuchsia introduce testable and tested code.

As with any Readability process, the guidelines and standards are best made
publicly available, for reviewers and reviewees. This document is the Fuchsia
Testability equivalent of a style guide for a programming language readability
process.

It’s valuable to apply the Testability standards consistently, hence it is
important that anyone involved in Testability should study the doc (whether
you’re reviewing changes or authoring them).

The exact contents of the doc may change over time.

### Your goals as a Testability reviewer

*   **Determine if the change is tested.** Apply `Code-Review+2` if you
    agree that it’s tested, and reply with a note for what’s missing if it’s not.
*   Apply the standard (this doc) consistently.
*   If the change needs to be amended to meet the standards, provide actionable
    feedback.
*   Promote Fuchsia testing & testability.
*   Identify cases not handled by this doc and propose changes.
*   **Uphold the standard** but also **apply your good judgement**. The goal is
    to improve quality and promote a culture of testing. You’re not expected to
    execute a precise decision algorithm.

### Your goals as a change author

*   Inform yourself of the standards by reading this doc (you’re doing it right
    now!).
*   Respect that your Testability reviewer is volunteering for the role, and
    treat them appropriately.
*   Consider feedback given for ways that you could improve confidence in your
    change using testing.

## What to test? How to test?

*   **Changes to functionality should have a test that would have failed without
    said change.**
*   **Tests must be local to the code being changed: dependencies with test
    coverage do not count as test coverage.** For example, if "A" is used by a
    "B", and the "B" contains tests, this does not provide coverage for "A".
    If bugs are caught with "B"'s tests, they will manifest indirectly, making
    them harder to pinpoint to "A". Similarly, if "B" is deprecated (or just
    changes its dependencies) all coverage for "A" would be lost.
*   **Tests must be automated (CI/CQ when supported)**. A manual test is not
    sufficient, because there is no guarantee that a future change to the code
    (especially when authored by another engineer) will exercise the same manual
    tests. Exceptions may apply to some parts of the codebase to recognize
    ongoing automation challenges.
*   **Tests must minimize their external dependencies**. Our test infrastructure
    explicitly provisions each test with certain resources, but tests are able
    to access more than those that are provisioned. Examples of resources
    include hardware, CPU, memory, persistent storage, network, other IO
    devices, reserved network ports, and system services. The stability and
    availability of resources that are not provisioned explicitly for a test
    cannot be guaranteed, so tests that access such resources are inherently
    flaky and / or difficult to reproduce. Tests must not access external
    resources beyond the control of the test infrastructure. For example, tests
    must not access services on the Internet. Tests should only use resources
    beyond those provisioned explicitly for that test when necessary. For
    example, tests might have to access system services that do not have test
    doubles available. A small number of exceptions to this rule are made for
    end-to-end tests.
*   **Changes to legacy code** (old code that predates Testability requirements
    and is poorly tested) must be tested. Proximity to poorly-tested code is not
    a reason to not test new code. Untested legacy code isn’t necessarily old
    and crufty, it may be proven and battle-hardened, whereas new code that
    isn’t tested is more likely to fail!
*   **Changes you are making to someone else’s code** are subject to the same
    Testability requirements. If the author is changing code they’re not
    familiar with or responsible for, that’s more reason to test it well. The
    author can be expected to work with the responsible individual or team to
    find effective ways to test the change. Individuals responsible for the code
    under change are expected to help the author with testability with the same
    priority as the author’s change.

## What does not require testing

Missing testing coverage for the below should not prevent a change from
receiving `Code-Review+2`.

*   **Logging.** In most cases, it’s probably not worth testing the log output
    of components. The log output is usually treated as opaque data by the rest
    of the system, which means changes to log output are unlikely to break other
    system. However, if the log output is load bearing in some way (e.g.,
    perhaps some other system depends on observing certain log messages), then
    that contract is worth testing. This can also apply to other forms of
    instrumentation, such as Tracing. This does not apply to instrumentation
    when it is used as a contract, for instance Inspect usage can be tested, and
    should be if you rely on it working as intended (for instance, in `ffx
    inspect` or feedback reports).
*   **Code that we don’t own** (the source of truth is not in Fuchsia tree).
    Changes that pick up an update to source code that’s copied from elsewhere
    don’t bear testability requirements.
*   **Pure refactors** (changes that could have entirely been made by an
    automated refactor tool), such as moving files, renaming symbols, or
    deleting them, don’t bear testability requirements. Some languages can have
    behavior that’s exposed to such changes (e.g. runtime reflection), so
    exceptions may apply.
*   **Generated code.** Changes that are generated by tools (such as formatting,
    or generated code checked in as a golden file) don’t bear testability
    requirements. As an aside, it’s generally discouraged to check in generated
    code (rather harness the tools and have the code be generated at build
    time), but in the exceptional case don’t require tests for code written by
    machines.
*   **Testability bootstrapping.** In cases where the change is in preparation
    for introducing testability to the code, and this is explicitly documented
    by the author, then Testability reviewers may exercise discretion and take
    an IOU.
*   **Manual tests.** Manual tests are often themselves used to test or
    demonstrate functionality that is hard to test in an automated fashion.
    Additions or modifications to manual tests therefore do not require
    automated tests. However, it is strongly recommended that manual tests be
    paired with a `README.md` or `TESTING.md` document describing how to run them.
*   **Hardcoded values.** Additions or changes to hardcoded values do not
    necessarily require tests. Oftentimes, these values control behaviors that
    are not easily observable, such as unexposed implementation
    details, heuristics, or "cosmetic" changes (e.g. background color of a UI).
    Tests of the style `assert_eq!(CONFIG_PARAM, 5);` are not considered useful
    and are not required by testability. However, if the contribution results
    in an easily observable behavioral change, that contribution should
    include a test for the new behavior.

## What does require testing

### If fixing a flake, test for flakiness in CQ

If fixing a flake, verify the fix by [testing for flakiness in CQ](/docs/development/testing/testing_for_flakiness_in_cq.md).

### Tests should not sleep

Sleeps can lead to flaky tests because timing is difficult to control across
different test environments.  Some factors that can contribute to this
difficulty this are the test target's CPU speed, number of cores, and system
load along with environmental factors like temperature.

*   Avoid something like:

    ```c++
    // Check if the callback was called.
    zx_nanosleep(zx_deadline_after(ZX_MSEC(100)));
    EXPECT_EQ(true, callback_happened);
    ```

*   Instead, explicitly wait for the condition:

    ```c++
    // In callback
    callback() {
        sync_completion_signal(&event_);
    }

    // In test
    sync_completion_wait(&event_, ZX_TIME_INFINITE);
    sync_completion_reset(&event_);
    ```

    This code sample was adapted from [`task_test.cc`](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/326106/7/src/camera/drivers/hw_accel/ge2d/test/task_test.cc#48).

### Regression tests for race conditions

It is difficult to write regression tests for race conditions that don't have a high
false-pass rate. If you can write a test that deterministically reproduces the issue,
you should do that. See [Write reproducible, deterministic tests][determinism]
for tips. Otherwise, if the data race was fixed by improving the locking
scheme used, you can add thread annotations as a regression test. For other races,
you should attempt to design APIs that prevent the existence of the race condition.

## Recently removed exemptions

*   **Engprod scripts** (e.g. `fx` commands) and **associated configuration files**
    no longer have an exemption from testability. `fx` must have integration
    tests before further changes land. Exceptions may be granted by the fx team
    after consulting with a testability reviewer.

## Temporary testability exemptions

The following are currently exempt from Testability, while ongoing work aims to
change that.

*   **Engprod scripts** in the `tools/devshell/contrib` and associated
    configuration are exempt.
*   **GN templates** are not easily testable. We are working on a test framework
    for GN templates. Until then, it's permitted for build template changes to
    be manually tested only.
*   **Resource leaks** are not easily preventable in C-style code. In the longer
    term, such code should be refactored to use Rust or modern C++ idioms to
    reduce the chances of leaks, and automation should exist that is capable of
    automatically detecting leaks.
*   **Gigaboot** is a UEFI bootloader in `//src/firmware/gigaboot` that predates
    testability policy. At present there is not an infrastructure available
    to write integration tests for the UEFI code. Introducing that
    infrastructure is tracked in fxbug.dev/34478. A testability exception is granted
    until fxbug.dev/34478 is addressed.
