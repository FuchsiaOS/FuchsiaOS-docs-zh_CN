# Escher

Escher is a C++/Vulkan library that is used primarily by the Scenic implementation; it is not
exposed by the Fuchsia SDK.

With a few exceptions, Escher is not platform-dependent.  For example, the Escher examples can also
be run on Linux and MacOS.

The source code lives in [//src/ui/lib/escher/][escher_src]
