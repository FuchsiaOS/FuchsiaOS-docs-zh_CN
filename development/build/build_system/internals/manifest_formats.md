# Manifest File Formats Used by The Fuchsia Build System

The Fuchsia build system uses a number of "manifest" files that indicate how to
install files into containers, for instance copying them into [Fuchsia package
archives][fuchsia-package-archive], or into the boot filesystem image
of a [ZBI file][glossary.zircon boot image].

This page documents these file formats which are used within the build, but
should not be exposed outside of it.

Note that the scripts and `.gni` files that generate and process these files
are located under `//build/dist/` in the Fuchsia source tree.

## FINI (Fuchsia INI) manifest file format {#fini-manifest}

The FINI manifest format is used by several tools invoked during the build: the
[`ffx package build`][ffx-tool] command (or the legacy [`pm`][pm-tool] tool) that
generates Fuchsia package archives or the [`zbi`][zbi-tool] tool which generates
ZBI images.

The syntax is very simple: each line of text looks like `<destination>=<source>`,
where `<destination>` is a destination file path, relative to the top of the
final container, and `<source>` is a file path to the source content, relative
to the current directory (i.e. the build directory in most cases).

Note that the destination path should _never_ begin with a directory separator,
and that FINI files do not support comments, sections, and other features of the
[Windows INI file format][windows-ini]{:.external}

For example:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
bin/foo=foo
lib/ld.so.1=user.libc_x64/libc.so
meta/foo.cm=obj/src/foo/cml/foo_component/foo.cm
meta/package=gen/src/foo/foo_meta_package.txt
```


## Distribution manifest file format {#distribution-manifest}

This is a JSON file that must contain a list, where each item is a JSON object
as a single "distribution" entry, which describes how to install one
source file into a container, as well as provide a GN label for the target
that generated it. The schema used here is:

- `source`: A source path string (REQUIRED).

- `destination`: A destination path string (REQUIRED).

- `label`: A GN label pointing to the target that generated the source file.
   Only used for debugging (OPTIONAL).

Example:

```json {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
  {
    "destination": "bin/foo",
    "source": "x64-asan/foo",
    "label": "//some/dir:foo"
  }
```

While conceptually similar to [FINI manifests](#fini-manifest), distribution
manifests provide a little bit more information (the GN label), which is highly
useful for debugging when things go wrong. They are also consumed by a different set
of tools.

## Partial distribution manifest file format {#partial-distribution-manifest}

[FINI](#fini-manifest) and [distribution manifests](#distribution-manifest)
are generated by processing intermediate files called "partial distribution manifests".

A partial manifest is generated by GN metadata collection over targets
in the same dependency tree. It is a JSON file that contains a list of
object "entries".

Several types of entries are used to describe various aspects of the
build and installation requirements. They are all merged into either a
FINI or distribution manifest.

The Python module at `//build/dist/distribution_manifest.py` contains
the functions used to process these files.

### Regular entries

These entries match the schema used for distribution manifests. They
correspond to a simple source file to install to a given destination
path.

- `source`: A source path string (REQUIRED).

- `destination`: A destination path string (REQUIRED).

- `label`: A GN label pointing to the target that generated the source file.
   Only used for debugging (OPTIONAL).

- `elf_runtime_dir`: Only used for ELF executables and loadable modules,
   an optional destination directory path that specifies where this
   binary's ELF dependencies should be at runtime.
   Default value is "lib"

When used to generate a distribution manifest, they are copied as-is,
without the `elf_runtime_dir` key into the output file, unless one
of the following conditions are met:

  - they have the same source as another regular entry (see
    [this section](#duplicate-entries) for details), in which case only
    one of the entries is preserved.

  - its source path is used by a renamed entry (see below).

Example:

```json {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
  {
    "destination": "bin/foo",
    "source": "x64-asan/foo",
    "label": "//some/dir:foo",
    "elf_runtime_dir": "lib/asan"
  },
```

### Copy entries.

These entries are used to indicate that the build copied a specific file to
a new output location. This information is later used to process renamed
entries properly (see below), and are otherwise ignored. Their schema is:

- `copy_from`: A source path string, relative to the build directory
  (REQUIRED).

- `copy_to`: A destination path string, relative to the build directory
   (REQUIRED).

- `label`: A GN label pointing to the target that generated this entry
   (OPTIONAL).

For example, the following entry is used to indicate that the 'foo'
executable binary, built with the "asan" build variant in
`${BUILD_DIR}/x64-asan/foo` was also copied to `${BUILD_DIR}/foo`.

Example:

```json {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
  {
    "copy_from": "x64-asan/foo",
    "copy_to": "foo"
    "label": "//some/dir:foo"
  }
```

See the section below that explains how copy and renamed entries interact,
with an actual example.

### Renamed entries

These entries are used to indicate that a given regular entry should be
installed at an alternative destination location. This is useful for certain
programs (e.g. `busybox`) which will behave differently, depending on the
program name used to launch them. The `renamed_binary()` GN template relies on
them. Their schema is:

- `destination`: A destination path string (REQUIRED).

- `renamed_source`: A source path that matches another regular entry
  (REQUIRED).

- `label`: A GB label pointing to the target that generated this entry
  (OPTIONAL).

- `keep_original`: A boolean flag, set to true to indicate that the original
  renamed binary should still be installed in the container (OPTIONAL).

Note that a renaming entry can  only point to the `source` path of a regular
entry, or to the `copy_to` path of a copy entry. Using an unknown path, or the
destination path of another renaming entry is a build error.

It is possible to rename the same entry multiple times. This is useful when the
same original binary needs to be installed several times under different names.

Here is an example where the `busybox` binary is installed as `bin/cp`,
`bin/cat` and `bin/ls` in the same container. Note that `bin/busybox` will
*not* be installed to the container though.


```json {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
  {
    "destination": "bin/busybox",
    "source": "busybox",
    "label": "//third_party/busybox:busybox"
  },
  {
    "destination": "bin/cp",
    "renamed_from": "busybox"
  },
  {
    "destination": "bin/cat",
    "renamed_from": "busybox"
  },
  {
    "destination": "bin/ls",
    "renamed_from": "busybox"
  }
```

If any renaming entry sets the `keep_original` flag to true, the original entry
is not removed from the manifest, keeping the original binary in it, as in:

```json {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
  {
    "destination": "bin/busybox",
    "source": "busybox",
    "label": "//third_party/busybox:busybox"
  },
  {
    "destination": "bin/cp",
    "renamed_from": "busybox",
    "keep_original": true
  }
```

Which will ensure that both `bin/busybox` and `bin/cp` are installed into the
container.

### File entries

These entries are used to include other distribution manifest files, which
may be generated by a different target. Their schema is:

- `file`: A file path string, pointing to another distribution manifest
  file (REQUIRED).

- `label`: A default GN label that will be applied to all entries in the
  included file, if they don't have their own `label` value (OPTIONAL).

Distribution file includes can be recursive.

Example:

```json {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
  {
    "file": "path/to/other.dist_manifest",
    "label": "//some/dir:label"
  }
```

## Duplicate entries in manifest files {#duplicate-entries}

Due to the way the Fuchsia build works, it is possible for manifest files (of any
format) to provide multiple entries that use the same `<destination> `path. This is
however valid as long as the source paths, or their content, are identical; in which
case duplicates will simply be ignored.

The case where multiple entries have the same destination path, but different
source path _and_ content, is treated as a build error by the processing
scripts.

## Interaction between copy and renamed entries

To clarify how copy and rename entries interact, consider the example of a given
`renamed_binary()` target used to rename the install location of a `foo` binary.
When no build variants are selected, the corresponding build manifest will contain
two entries that look like this:

```json {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
  {
    "destination": "bin/foo",
    "source": "foo",
    "label": "//src:foo",
  },
  {
    "destination": "bin/foo_renamed",
    "renamed_from": "foo",
  },
```

The first regular entry tells that `${BUILD_DIR}/foo` was built by the
`//src:foo` target in the default toolchain, and should be installed to
`bin/foo` inside containers.

The second copy entry tells that the binary built as `${BUILD_DIR}/foo` should
really be instealled to `bin/foo_renamed` instead of its default location
(i.e. `bin/foo`).

Logically speaking, this is equivalent to a single entry:


```json {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
  {
    "destination": "bin/foo_renamed",
    "source": "foo",
    "label": "//src/foo",
  },
```

I.e. the first entry, where only the destination path was changed.

However, when building the same thing with the `asan` variant is enabled,
the manifest content will be slightly different than before:


```json {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
  {
    "destination": "bin/foo",
    "source": "x64-asan/foo",
    "label": "//src:foo(//build/toolchain:x64-asan)",
  },
  {
    "copy_from": "x64-asan/foo",
    "copy_to": "foo",
  },
  {
    "destination": "bin/foo_renamed",
    "renamed_from": "foo",
  },
```

Now, the first entry tells that `${BUILD_DIR}/x64-asan/foo` was built
by the `//src:foo` target in the asan toolchain (`//build/toolchain:x64-asan`),
and still be installed by default to `bin/foo`.

The second entry tells that `${BUILD_DIR}/foo` is an actual copy of
`${BUILD_DIR}/x64-asan/foo`, because that's what our build system does.

The third entry is the same as before, because the `renamed_binary()` target
doesn't know anything about which toolchain or variant was used to build
`${BUILD_DIR}/foo`.

This is all logically equivalent to a single entry that looks like:

```json {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
  {
    "destination": "bin/foo_renamed",
    "source": "x64-shared/foo",
    "label": "//src/foo(//build/toolchain:x64-asan)",
  },
```

Copy entries are only used when build variants are enabled, they link renamed
entries with the variant-specific regular entries. The reason all this
information is spread out is that each entry is generated through a different
target in our build graph, and that there is no way to link everything together
during the GN generation pass.
