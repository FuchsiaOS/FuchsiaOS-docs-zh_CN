# Object usage

Processes create and use kernel objects to perform work. Just as memory can
be leaked or misused (e.g use-after-free), handles to kernel object can
be leaked or misused (e.g use-after-close).

## Handles tool

To help developers diagnose handle issues use the `handles` tool, below
is a sample of process 29831 which is wlancfg.cmx :

```

38 handles
```

The `handles <pid>` tool dumps the process handle table, which holds all
accessible handles for that particular process at the moment of invocation.

For each handle the tool prints the handle value, the koid of the object it
points to, the related koid (rkoid) if the object has a related object, the
rights of the handle and the type of object.

In the example above, it shows 38 unique handles, which map to 36 unique
objects; 3 of the handles point to the same "log" object with koid 1129.

It should be noted that not all alive objects might be displayed by the tool.
For example, a thread can be alive even if there are not handles open to it and
VMOs can be held alive by the associated VMAR.

The `handles` tool supports filtering and reverse filtering by object type; use
`handles --help` to see all the options.

## Handles in the debugger

You can view handle information using the [debugger](/docs/development/debugger/kernel_objects.md).
To do this, attach to the process in question and run the `handles` command. This shows the handle
value, object type, and object koid:

```
[zxdb] handles
  504103211  ZX_OBJ_TYPE_VMO        27851
  504103271  ZX_OBJ_TYPE_VMO        27719
  505151859  ZX_OBJ_TYPE_VMO        27720
  505151867  ZX_OBJ_TYPE_VMO        27718
  506200511  ZX_OBJ_TYPE_PORT       27976
  507249163  ZX_OBJ_TYPE_VMAR       27716
  508297363  ZX_OBJ_TYPE_VMO        28200
  508297379  ZX_OBJ_TYPE_VMO        28187
  508297387  ZX_OBJ_TYPE_SOCKET     28189
  508297731  ZX_OBJ_TYPE_CLOCK       1263
  508297735  ZX_OBJ_TYPE_LOG         1275
  508297755  ZX_OBJ_TYPE_LOG         1275
```

You can also view basic information about a handle by calling `handle` and specifying a handle
value:

```
[zxdb] handle 508302371
          Type  ZX_OBJ_TYPE_CHANNEL
         Value  508302371
        Rights  ZX_RIGHT_TRANSFER
                ZX_RIGHT_READ
                ZX_RIGHT_WRITE
                ZX_RIGHT_SIGNAL
                ZX_RIGHT_SIGNAL_PEER
                ZX_RIGHT_WAIT
                ZX_RIGHT_INSPECT
          Koid  31062
  Related koid  31061

```

If the object referenced by the handle is related to another object (such as the other end of a
channel, or the parent of a job) then `related_koid` is the koid of that other object. If there is
no other related object, this value is zero. In this example, the related koid is the other end of
the channel. This relationship is immutable: an object's `related_koid` does not change even if the
related object no longer exists.

## Bad handle policy

Using a handle after it has been [closed](/docs/reference/syscalls/handle_close.md)
or closing a handle that has been already closed are mistakes that can create
hard to diagnose errors.

In order to help developers find these issues, the "bad handle" Job policy can
be activated using [zx_job_set_policy](/docs/reference/syscalls/job_set_policy.md)
with the condition **ZX_POL_BAD_HANDLE** and the action
**ZX_POL_ACTION_ALLOW_EXCEPTION**. When a process is launched under a job with
this policy, any use of an already closed handle will generate an exception
that if not handled will terminate the process and log the offending call stack
or that can be trapped by the [debugger](/docs/development/idk/documentation/debugger.md)
for interactive troubleshooting.
