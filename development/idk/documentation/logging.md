# Logging

The preferred way to publish logs is to use the `syslog` API, currently
available for C in `//pkg/syslog`.

The library provides the ability to tag logs so that they can later be filtered
upon retrieval.

In order to get logs from a device, open a shell on the device as described in
[this document](ssh.md) and run:
```
$ log_listener
```

To view specifics logs, add a tag specification:
```
$ log_listener --tag foobar
```

See [log_listener CLI] for a list of available flags.

## Symbolization

`//tools/symbolizer` should be used to symbolize stack traces. It should be
pointed to the `.build-id` directory at the root of the SDK, where debug symbols
are hosted:

```posix-terminal
symbolizer --build-id-dir .build-id
```
