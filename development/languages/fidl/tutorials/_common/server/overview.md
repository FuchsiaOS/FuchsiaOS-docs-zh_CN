This tutorial shows you how to implement a FIDL protocol
(`fuchsia.examples.Echo`) and run it on Fuchsia. This protocol has one method
of each kind: a fire and forget method, a two-way method, and an event:

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="examples/fidl/fuchsia.examples/echo.test.fidl" region_tag="echo" %}
```

For more on FIDL methods and messaging models, refer to the [FIDL concepts][concepts] page.

This document covers how to complete the following tasks:

* Implement a FIDL protocol.
* Build and run a package on Fuchsia.
* Serve a FIDL protocol.

The tutorial starts by creating a component that is served to a Fuchsia device
and run. Then, it gradually adds functionality to get the server up and running.
