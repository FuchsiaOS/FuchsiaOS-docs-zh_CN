## Prerequisites

This tutorial builds on the [FIDL server][server-tut] tutorial. For the
full set of FIDL tutorials, refer to the [overview][overview].

## Overview

This tutorial implements a client for a FIDL protocol and runs it
against the server created in the [previous tutorial][server-tut]. The client in this
tutorial is asynchronous. There is an [alternate tutorial][sync-client] for
synchronous clients.

If you want to write the code yourself, delete the following directories:

[server-tut]: /docs/development/languages/fidl/tutorials/cpp/basics/server.md
[sync-client]: /docs/development/languages/fidl/tutorials/cpp/basics/sync-client.md
