# Contribute changes

This guide provides instructions on how to submit your contribution to the
Fuchsia project.

## Prerequisites

Fuchsia manages git commits and code reviews through
[Gerrit's](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com){:.external} web UI.

Before you begin, you need to:

*   [Download the Fuchsia source code](/get-started/get_fuchsia_source.md).

    Note: You can complete the next prerequisite items while downloading the
    Fuchsia source code.

*   [Sign the Google Contributor License Agreements (CLA)](#sign-the-google-cla).

*   [Generate a cookie to authenticate you in Gerrit](#generate-a-cookie).

### Sign the Google CLA {#sign-the-google-cla}

Do the following:

1.  Go to the Google Developers'
    [Contributor License Agreements](https://cla.developers.google.com/){:.external}
    page.
1.  Sign the agreement on behalf of **Only Yourself** or **Your Employer**.

### Generate a cookie {#generate-a-cookie}

Do the following:

1.  Log into [Gerrit](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com){:.external}.
1.  Go to
    [https://fuchsia.googlesource.com](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com){:.external}.
1.  At the top of the page, click **Generate Password**.
1.  Copy the generated code and run it in a terminal of your workstation.

## Create a change in Gerrit {#create-a-change-in-gerrit}

The Fuchsia project uses Gerrit's web-based UI to manage code and
documentation reviews. When a commit is uploaded to Gerrit, it is referred to as
as a **change**.

To create a
[change](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/concept-changes.html){:.external}
in Gerrit, do the following:

1.  Go to your Fuchsia directory, for example:

    ```posix-terminal
    cd ~/fuchsia
    ```

1.  Create a new branch:

    ```posix-terminal
    git checkout -b <branch_name>
    ```

1.  Create or edit files in the new branch.

1.  Add the updated files:

    ```posix-terminal
    git add <files>
    ```

1.  Commit the updated files and
[write the change message](/contribute/commit-message-style-guide.md):

    ```posix-terminal
    git commit
    ```

1.  Upload the commit to Gerrit:

You can use `jiri` or `git`.

`jiri` is a tool for working with multiple repositories that is [installed with Fuchsia](/get-started/get_fuchsia_source.md).
To upload your commit:

```posix-terminal
jiri upload
```

See also the [Jiri documentation](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/jiri/+/HEAD/README.md) for more information.

If you want to use the `git` command instead, run the following command:

```posix-terminal
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/main
```

See the
[Gerrit documentation](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.12.3/intro-user.html#upload-change){:.external}
for more information.

### Request a code review

After creating a change, to request a code review, do the following:

1. Go to your [Fuchsia Gerrit dashboard](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/dashboard/self).
1. Click your change, which appears in the *Outgoing reviews* section.
1. Click **ADD REVIEWER**.
1. Add reviewers by email address. You can refer to the `OWNERS` file, located in the directory
where you're making your change or in one of its parents to find the best reviewers for your change.
1. Click **SEND**.

#### Track your review

To track the progress of your code review, use
[Gerrit](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com){:.external}. For more
information on how to use the Gerrit code review tool, see
[Review UI documentation](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/user-review-ui.html){:.external}.

After you request a code review for your change, reviewers can score
your change. Reviewers can label your change with a
score of **-2**, **-1**, **0**, **+1**, or **+2**. For more information on
review label definitions see, [Gerrit Code Review - Review Labels](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/config-labels.html){:.external}.

In order for your change to be submitted, you need a **Code Review Label +2**.
A **Code Review Label +2** score can only be applied by a directory owner.

#### Submit your change {#submit-a-change}

A change can be submitted after a repository owner applies the
**Code Review Label +2** to your change. When a change is submitted, the change
is submitted to the Commit Queue (CQ). The Commit Queue verifies and
merges changes to the `main` branch.

**Only contributors with [commit access](/contribute/community/contributor-roles.md#committer)** can submit code directly
through the Gerrit interface. Regular members need to ask a Committer to submit code for them.

### Create and upload a patch

After creating a change, to upload a patch to your change, do the following:

1.  Create or edit files in the same branch.
1.  Add the updated files:

    ```posix-terminal
    git add <files>
    ```

1.  Include the patch in the same commit using the `--amend` option:

    ```posix-terminal
    git commit --amend
    ```

1.  Upload the patch to Gerrit:

    ```posix-terminal
    jiri upload
    ```

### Resolve merge conflicts {#resolve-merge-conflicts}

When Gerrit warns you of merge conflicts in your change, do the following:

1.  Rebase from `origin/main`, which reveals the files that cause merge
    conflicts:

    ```posix-terminal
    git rebase origin/main
    ```

1.  Edit those files to resolve the conflicts and finish the rebase:

    ```posix-terminal
    git add <files_with_resolved_conflicts>
    ```

    ```posix-terminal
    git rebase --continue
    ```

1.  Upload the patch to your change:

    ```posix-terminal
    git commit --amend
    ```

    ```posix-terminal
    jiri upload
    ```

### Delete your local branch

After the change is submitted, you may delete your local branch:

```posix-terminal
git branch -d <branch_name>
```

## Write a change message {#write-a-change-message}

When writing a change message, follow the [Commit message style
guide](/contribute/commit-message-style-guide.md).

## Contribute a change to the API

To contribute to the
[Fuchsia API Surface](/glossary/README.md#fuchsia-api-surface), do the following:

* Evaluate whether your change is large or small.

    * If you have a small, incremental change to the API, contribute your
    change by completing the steps in
    [create a change in Gerrit](#create-a-change-in-gerrit), as you would for
    any Fuchsia source code change.
    * If you have a large change to the API, that is, a change that
    significantly expands on the fuction of the API or modifies the
    API extensively, do the following:
        * Create an [RFC](/contribute/governance/rfcs/TEMPLATE.md) that
        explains the design of your modification to the API.
        * This RFC should be reviewed through the normal [RFC
        process](/contribute/governance/rfcs/rfc_process.md). The API
        reviewer for the relevant area should be a stakeholder in the RFC. See
        the [Fuchsia API Council
        Charter](/contribute/governance/api_council.md#area) to identify
        API reviewers.
        * After your API RFC is approved, contribute your change by
        completing the steps in
        [create a change in Gerrit](#create-a-change-in-gerrit), as you would
        for any Fuchsia source code change.

* [Request a code review](#request_a_code_review) from an API council
member. Select your API council reviewer based on the area of the
Fuchsia API that you're modifying. For a list of API council members and their
areas of focus, see
[Membership](/contribute/governance/api_council.md#membership) in the
Fuchsia API Council Charter.

## Manage changes that span multiple repositories

To understand how to manage changes that span different repositories (petals),
see the following pages:

*   [Working across different petals](/development/source_code/working_across_petals.md)
*   [Upload changes from multiple repositories](/development/source_code/upload_changes_from_multiple_repositories.md)

See [Source code layout](/development/source_code/layout.md) for more
information on the structure of the Fuchsia repository.
