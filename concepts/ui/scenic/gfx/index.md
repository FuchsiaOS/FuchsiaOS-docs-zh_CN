> **_ATTENTION:_** This document describes the behavior of Scenic's GFX API which is currently being replaced by the [Flatland API](/concepts/ui/scenic/flatland/index.md). Workstation currently uses Flatland only, and Smart Display will be converted to use Flatland as well. If working with Flatland, please refer to the [Flatland documentation](/concepts/ui/index.md).

# Gfx

Gfx is Scenic's legacy 3D API.
