# Overview

This section provides concepts that make up Fuchsia's user interface. These
concepts inform our thinking on graphics, views, and input. These guides are
*short*, *high level*, and *informational*.

Fuchsia-specific terms can be found in the [Glossary](/docs/glossary/README.md).

Detailed roadmaps, with concrete milestones, are found elsewhere.

Detailed design docs on precise architecture, contracts, etc are found
elsewhere.
