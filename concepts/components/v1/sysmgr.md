# sysmgr (Components v1)

<<../_v1_banner.md>>

sysmgr is one of the two major pieces of Components v1 (appmgr being the other).
It is responsible for hosting the `sys` [realm](/glossary/README.md#realm) that
contains `global` system services. (The term `realm` is used throughout this,
but note that in v1 it is a synonym for 'environment'.)

Most v1 components on Fuchsia today still run directly in the 'sys' realm,
especially those responsible for system-wide and non-user-facing functionality.
(Eventually, these will be migrated to the newer Components v2 runtime.) There
also exist many (often user-facing) components in child realms under 'sys', such
as components launched and managed by the Modular framework, that sysmgr is not
involved in launching or managing.

The services available in the 'sys' realm and the components that sysmgr
launches to provide those services are determined based on a set of sysmgr
configuration files. This doc describes how to add to sysmgr's
configuration, the different configration options sysmgr supports, and the
configuration format.

## Adding to sysmgr's configuration

At runtime, sysmgr loads all files present under /config/data in its namespace
and parses them using the format described below. This directory is provided to
sysmgr because it uses the 'config-data' feature in its component manifest,
sysmgr.cmx. For more details, see the docs on [the config-data
feature](/development/components/data.md).

You can make a new service available in the 'sys' realm by adding to sysmgr's
configuration. There are two supported ways to do so:

1. Unless there is a specific reason to do otherwise, [the centralized
   services.config file](/src/sys/sysmgr/config/services.config) that is
   included in the [core product config (core.gni)](/products/core.gni) and all
   derivative products can be updated.

2. Alternatively, a new GN `config_data` target can be defined and included in
   [product configurations](/products/README.md) to include an extra file in
   sysmgr's /config/data directory.

   A common reason to do this is to change the component that provides a given
   service depending on the product config, e.g. to use
   `fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/foo#meta/foo.cmx` in product1.gni and
   `fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/bar#meta/bar.cmx` in product2.gni to provide
   service `fuchsia.some.Service`. A similar reason is to change the command
   line arguments passed to the component depending on the product config in
   order to modify its behavior.

TODO(fxbug.dev/48215): There are recognized deficiencies with the centralized
services.config file, such as the fact that it is difficult to understand which
services are actually available on a given build since it depends on whether the
relevant package is available. We plan to address this during the migration to
the newer v2 Component Runtime, but in the meantime using services.config is
still the recommended default.

> Note: With either option, you must take care to ensure that there are no
> conflicts in the `services` configuration. For this reason, the best practice
> is to only include sysmgr `config_data` targets directly in product
> configuration files like core.gni, not in other GN group targets. For example,
> it is not recommended to depend on the sysmgr `config_data` target in your
> `package` target as this makes it impossible to override the configuration in
> a later derived product .
>
> If there are conflicts present, they will be caught at build time and you will
> see an error similar to this:
>
> ```
> Error: conflicts detected in sysmgr configuration
> Duplicate configuration for service fuchsia.my.Service in files: ../../some/path/default.config, ../../some/path/alternative.config
> ```
>
> TODO(fxbug.dev/48223): As a **TEMPORARY** workaround for build errors like this, you
> can set the `dangerous_allow_sysmgr_config_conflicts` GN variable to true. This
> variable will be removed shortly and should only be used locally by developers,
> not in product configs, as it results in non-deterministic behavior (sysmgr may
> pick any of the conflicting configs to use).

### Option #2 Example

In your `BUILD.gn`:

```gn
config_data("my_service_config") {
  for_pkg = "sysmgr"
  sources = "my_service.config"
}
```

And then in the appropriate `product.gni`:

```gn
base_package_labels += [
  ...
  "//path/to:my_service_config",
  ...
]
```

## sysmgr configuration format

sysmgr's configuration files are in JSON format. Each config file should have a
single top-level JSON object, and the following keys are supported:

* `services`
* `startup_services`
* `apps`
* `optional_services`
* `update_dependencies`
* `critical_components`

The contents of all sysmgr config files are read from sysmgr's /config/data
directory and merged at runtime to form sysmgr's overall configuration.

### `services`

This is the most common configuration key and where most of sysmgr's
configuration comes from. Each entry in the `services` map consists of a service
name and the component URL which provides it. Optionally, command line arguments
can be provided to the component by using an array instead of a string value.

```json
{
  "services": {
    "fuchsia.foo.Service": "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/foo#meta/foo.cmx",
    "fuchsia.bar.Service": [
        "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/bar#meta/bar.cmx", "arg1", "arg2", "arg3"
    ]
  }
}
```

The combined `services` map across all config files defines the list of services
that are available in the `sys` realm and that are available for other
components running in the `sys` realm to request in their component manifests.
It is not possible to add services to the `sys` realm in any other way; the list
of services is fixed at realm creation time.

Components in the `services` map are started lazily as the services they provide
are connected to. In other words, in the example above `foo.cmx` will not be
started until another component attempts to connect to `fuchsia.foo.Service`. If
your component needs to be started eagerly, see `startup_services` or `apps`
below.

### `startup_services` and `apps`

Both of these keys perform similar functions; they cause sysmgr to eagerly
launch components right after it creates the `sys` realm. The key difference is
that `startup_services` should be used to eagerly launch a component which is
providing services to the `sys` realm (i.e. there is an entry in the `services`
map that uses the component), whereas `apps` should be used to eagerly launch a
component which does not provide any services to `sys`.

For example, the following configuration would cause sysmgr to eagerly launch
the component that provides `fuchsia.foo.Service` (the same as if another
component attempted to connect to the service) as well as an instance of
`bar.cmx` and `baz.cmx` with the given arguments:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "fuchsia.foo.Service": "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/foo#meta/foo.cmx"
  },
  "startup_services": [
    "fuchsia.foo.Service"
  ],
  "apps": [
    "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/bar#meta/bar.cmx",
    [ "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/baz#meta/baz.cmx", "arg1", "arg2", "arg3" ]
  ]
}
```

It is important to not mix up usage of `startup_services` and `apps`. Using
`apps` instead of `startup_services` can result in sysmgr starting two separate
instances of your component, which is likely unintended. For example, the
example below would result in two instances of foo.cmx, one started eagerly and
the other started lazily when another component connects to
`fuchsia.foo.Service`:

```json
// WARNING: This is an example of what NOT to do.
{
  "services": {
    "fuchsia.foo.Service": "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/foo#meta/foo.cmx"
  }
  "apps": [
    "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/foo#meta/foo.cmx"
  ]
}
```

### `optional_services`

`optional_services` causes sysmgr to treat the corresponding `services` entry as
optional. In concrete terms all this means is that sysmgr will skip printing
error logs if the launching the component that provides the service fails
because it was not present or if the component crashes or exits.

```json
// WARNING: This is an example of what NOT to do.
{
  "services": {
    "fuchsia.foo.Service": "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/foo#meta/foo.cmx"
  },
  "optional_services: [
    "fuchsia.foo.Service"
  ]
}
```

### `update_dependencies`

Warning: Here be dragons. You should not modify this configuration unless you
are working on the Software Delivery stack.

`update_dependencies` is a list of services that the package resolver depends
on.  sysmgr implements the link between component resolution (through
fuchsia.sys.Loader) and the package resolver and needs this information to break
dependency cycles, e.g. so that starting the resolver does not first attempt to
resolve or update the resolver.

```json
{
  "services": {
    "fuchsia.pkg.PackageResolver": "...",
    "fuchsia.needed.for.Resolver": "..."
  },
  "update_dependencies: [
    "fuchsia.pkg.PackageResolver",
    "fuchsia.needed.for.Resolver"
  ]
}
```

The implementation details are subject to change, but as of 2020-04-29
`update_dependencies` currently does two things:

1. All services listed in `update_dependencies` must be present somewhere in the
   combined `services` map. If any service is missing, ephemeral package updates
   will be disabled.

2. The `fuchsia.sys.Loader` implementation which sysmgr provides to ephemerally
   update packages in the `sys` realm - `PackageUpdatingLoader` - is configured
   to not use the package resolver (to avoid attempting to update) any package
   which provides a service listed in `update_dependencies`.

   This avoids cycles, since the `fuchsia.pkg.PackageResolver` service that
   `PackageUpdatingLoader` uses to ephemerally resolve packages is itself part
   of the `sys` realm.

If the `auto_update_packages` GN arg is set to false, `update_dependencies` has
no effect. It is only relevant for ephemeral package updates.

### `critical_components`

Disclaimer: this feature is not intended for general use. Please consult before
using.

Critical components are a list of components which cause the system to reboot
if they ever terminate. The primary use-case are components which are critical to
the system's functionality and must always be running. Note that listing a
component under `critical_components` does not mean it will necessarily launch
when sysmgr starts; the component may initially launch through other means,
such as via `startup_services`.

Here is an example configuration snippet:

```json
{
  "startup_services": [
    "fuchsia.update.Manager"
  ],
  "services": {
    "fuchsia.update.Manager": "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/system-update-checker#meta/system-update-checker.cmx"
  },
  "critical_components": [
    "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/system-update-checker#meta/system-update-checker.cmx"
  ]
}
```

In the example above, `system-update-checker.cmx` is launched when sysmgr starts
up because it provides a startup service. If system-update-checker.cmx ever
exits, the system is rebooted.
