# Simple

Fuchsia is a modern, open source operating system designed to power a diverse
ecosystem of hardware and software. Fuchsia makes it easy for product creators
to build and maintain fleets of secure, high performing devices over long time
horizons.

## Fuchsia prioritizes clarity and minimalism in its architecture and design

**Fuchsia strives to be easy to understand and easy to maintain**

Fuchsia provides the core foundations of an operating system—like hardware
access, resource management, and software abstraction—in a coherent way,
creating a robust, stable platform for products.

## Bring your own runtime

**Fuchsia Interface Definition Language ([FIDL][glossary.FIDL]) allows diverse clients and
services to interoperate**

Fuchsia is highly extensible: developers are free to use their application
runtime and programming language of choice. Software from different runtimes
can integrate together to form a cohesive experience.

## Binary stable drivers

**[Fuchsia's Driver Framework][fuchsia-driver-framework] makes it simple to maintain hardware support over
long term system updates**

Stable ABIs make it possible for the operating system, device drivers, and
product software to remain compatible over longer time horizons. This makes it
easy to scale an open ecosystem of hardware—without forking the operating
system.
