# Drivers

Drivers provide software interfaces for communicating with hardware (or virtual)
devices that are embedded in or connected to a system. In Fuchsia, drivers are
user-space [components][components]. Like any other Fuchsia component, a driver
is software that exposes and receives FIDL capabilities to and from other
components in the system. Using these FIDL calls, Fuchsia components interact
with drivers, which are bound to specific devices in the system.

Similar to Fuchsia’s component framework, which manages Fuchsia components, the
[driver framework][driver-framework] manages the lifecycle and topology of
all devices (known as [nodes][nodes]) and drivers in a Fuchsia system.
