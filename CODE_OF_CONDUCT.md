# Fuchsia Code of Conduct

Google and the Fuchsia team are committed to preserving and fostering a diverse, welcoming community. Below is our community code of conduct, which applies to our repos and organizations, mailing lists, blog content, IRC channel and any other Fuchsia-supported communication group, as well as any private communication initiated in the context of these spaces. Simply put, community discussions should be the following:

- Respectful and kind
- About Fuchsia
- About features and code, not the individuals involved

## Be respectful and constructive

Treat everyone with respect. Build on each other's ideas. Each of us has the right to enjoy our experience and participate without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or subtle. Remember that Fuchsia is a geographically distributed team and that you may not be communicating with someone in their primary language. We all get frustrated when working on hard problems, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into personal attacks.

## Speak up if you see or hear something

You are empowered to politely engage when you feel that you or others are disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing. Politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged.

If you are uncomfortable speaking up, or feel that your concerns are not being duly considered, you can email <community-managers@fuchsia.dev> to request involvement from a community manager. All concerns shared with community managers will be kept confidential, but you may also submit an anonymous report [here](https://goo.gl/forms/xgisUdowrEWrYgui2). Please note that without a way to contact you, an anonymous report may be difficult to act on. You may also create a throwaway account to report. In cases where a public response is deemed necessary, the identities of victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

While all reports will be taken seriously, the Fuchsia community managers may not act on complaints that they feel are not violations of this code of conduct.

## Harassment is not tolerated

Harassment is not tolerated, including, but not limited to the following:

- Harassing comments
- Intimidation
- Encouraging a person to engage in self-harm
- Sustained disruption or derailing of threads, channels, lists, and similar forums
- Offensive or violent comments, jokes, or otherwise
- Inappropriate sexual content
- Unwelcome sexual or otherwise aggressive attention
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
- Distribution or threat of distribution of people's personally identifying information, also known as “doxing”

## Consequences for failing to comply with this policy

Consequences for failing to comply with this policy may include any of the following, at the sole discretion of the Fuchsia community managers:

- A request for an apology
- A private or public warning or reprimand
- A temporary ban from the mailing list, blog, Fuchsia repository or organization, or other Fuchsia-supported communication group, including loss of committer status
- A permanent ban from any of the above, or from all current and future Fuchsia-supported or Google-supported communities, including loss of committer status.

Participants warned to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Failure to do so will result in an escalation of consequences. The decisions of the Fuchsia community managers may be appealed at <community-managers@fuchsia.dev>.
