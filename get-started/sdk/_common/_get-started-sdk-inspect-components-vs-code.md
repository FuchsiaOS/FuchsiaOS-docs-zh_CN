Retrieve a component's data exposed by Fuchsia's Inspect API. This data can be
any set of specialized information that a Fuchsia component is programmed to
collect while it is running on the device.

Note: For a component to collect and expose inspect data, the implementation of
inspect operations and data types must be placed in the componentâ€™s code.
Developers use this inspect feature to collect and expose information that will
be helpful for debugging the component or the system. For details, see
[Fuchsia component inspection overview][inspect-overview].

The tasks include:

- Scan the list of components on the device that expose inspect data (for
  example, the `bootstrap/archivist` component).
- Scan the list of selectors provided by the `bootstrap/archivist` component.
- Inspect a specific set of data from the `bootstrap/archivist` component.

In VS Code, do the following:

1. Click the **TERMINAL** tab on the VS Code panel.

1. In the terminal, view the list of components on the device that expose
   inspect data:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx inspect list
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx inspect list
   <component_manager>
   bootstrap/archivist
   bootstrap/driver_manager
   bootstrap/fshost
   bootstrap/fshost/blobfs
   bootstrap/fshost/fxfs
   ...
   core/ui/scenic
   core/vulkan_loader
   core/wlancfg
   core/wlandevicemonitor
   core/wlanstack
   ```

   Notice that the `bootstrap/archivist` component is on the list.

1. View all available selectors for the `bootstrap/archivist` component:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx inspect selectors bootstrap/archivist
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx inspect selectors bootstrap/archivist
   bootstrap/archivist:root/archive_accessor_stats/all/inspect/batch_iterator/get_next:errors
   bootstrap/archivist:root/archive_accessor_stats/all/inspect/batch_iterator/get_next:requests
   bootstrap/archivist:root/archive_accessor_stats/all/inspect/batch_iterator/get_next:responses
   ...
   ```

   Each of these selectors represents a different type of data you can inspect.

1. Inspect the `bootstrap/archivist` component for the recent events data:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx inspect show bootstrap/archivist:root/events/recent_events
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx inspect show bootstrap/archivist:root/events/recent_events
   bootstrap/archivist:
     metadata:
       filename = fuchsia.inspect.Tree
       component_url = fuchsia-boot:///#meta/archivist.cm
       timestamp = 705335717538

             361:
               @time = 6272744049
               event = component_stopped
               moniker = core/trace_manager/cpuperf_provider
             362:
               @time = 6283370267
               event = log_sink_requested
               moniker = core/session-manager
             ...
             556:
               @time = 415796882099
               event = log_sink_requested
               moniker = core/debug_agent
             557:
               @time = 453898419738
               event = component_started
               moniker = core/ffx-laboratory:hello_world
             558:
               @time = 453899964568
               event = log_sink_requested
               moniker = core/ffx-laboratory:hello_world
             559:
               @time = 453900332656
               event = log_sink_requested
               moniker = core/ffx-laboratory:hello_world
             560:
               @time = 495458923475
               event = component_stopped
               moniker = core/ffx-laboratory:hello_world
   ```

   This data records all the events triggered by components on the device so
   far.
