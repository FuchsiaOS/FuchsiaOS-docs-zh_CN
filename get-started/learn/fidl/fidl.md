# Fuchsia Interface Definition Language

<<../../_common/fidl/_fidl_intro.md>>

## Creating a FIDL library

**FIDL libraries** group FIDL source files together. A library acts as a
namespace for the protocols it contains, and FIDL source files can implicitly
access all other declarations within the same library. FIDL source files must
**import** any declarations from another library.

The Fuchsia build system provides the `fidl()` build target to compile FIDL
source files into a library. The name of the library target must match the
`library` declarations in each source file. See the following `BUILD.gn` example
for the `fuchsia.examples` library:

```gn
# Import the fidl GN template.
import("//build/fidl/fidl.gni")

# Define a FIDL library target.
fidl("fuchsia.examples") {
  # FIDL source files contained in library
  sources = [
    "echo.fidl",
  ]
}
```

<aside class="key-point">
By default, the build system uses the <code>fidl()</code> GN target name as the
library name. You can override this behavior with the <code>name</code>
parameter.
</aside>

At build time, the FIDL Compiler (`fidlc`) frontend tool validates and compiles
the library source files into a JSON Intermediate Representation (IR). This JSON
IR format is the basis for the FIDL bindings.

## Generating FIDL bindings

Components consume FIDL protocols through generated code called
**FIDL bindings**. Bindings encode and decode requests and responses as
**FIDL messages** and transfer them over the underlying IPC channel. The
language-specific binding libraries provide wrappers around these structures to
align interactions with familiar programming idioms.

The client interface (sometimes referred to as a proxy) performs translation
between higher-level function calls and FIDL messages. On the server side,
bindings process incoming request messages and deliver them through an abstract
interface for components to implement.

 function calls into FIDL messages for transport across process
  boundaries.](/docs/get-started/images/fidl/fidl-bindings.png){: width="574"}


Note: For more details on the bindings specification and supported programming
languages, see the [Bindings Reference](/docs/reference/fidl/bindings/overview.md).

At build time, the `fidlgen` backend tools generate bindings for supported
programming languages from the JSON IR library produced by `fidlc`. For example,
`fidlgen_rust` generates Rust bindings from the JSON IR.

The `fidl()` library target creates individual binding targets for each
supported language. Due to the nature of GN, these bindings are not generated
at build time unless they are included as a dependency.

See the following example `BUILD.gn` snippet that includes the generated
bindings target for the `fuchsia.examples` library:

* {Rust}

  ```gn
  deps = [
    "fidl/fuchsia.examples:fuchsia.examples_rust",
    ...
  ]
  ```

* {C++}

  ```gn
  deps = [
    "fidl/fuchsia.examples:fuchsia.examples",
    ...
  ]
  ```

## Exercise: Echo FIDL Library

In this section, you'll define a new FIDL library with a protocol called
`Echo` containing a single method that returns string values back to the
caller.

Start by creating a new directory for the FIDL library target:

```posix-terminal
mkdir -p vendor/fuchsia-codelab/echo-fidl
```

Create the following file and directory structure in the new project directory:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
//vendor/fuchsia-codelab/echo-fidl
                        |- BUILD.gn
                        |- echo.fidl
```

Add a new FIDL interface file called `echo.fidl` with the following contents:

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="examples/components/routing/fidl/echo.fidl" region_tag="fidl_echo" adjust_indentation="auto" %}
```

`EchoString` is a two-way method that accepts an optional (nullable) string
value and returns the same value.

Add a `BUILD.gn` file with the following contents to declare the library target:

```gn
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="examples/components/routing/fidl/BUILD.gn" region_tag="fidl_echo" adjust_indentation="auto" %}
```

Add the library target to the build configuration:

<!-- TODO(fxbug.dev/108355): Update this when fidl_toolchain is removed. -->

* {Rust}

  ```posix-terminal
  fx set workstation_eng.qemu-x64 --with vendor/fuchsia-codelab/echo-fidl:echo_rust
  ```

* {C++}

  ```posix-terminal
  fx set workstation_eng.qemu-x64 --with vendor/fuchsia-codelab/echo-fidl:echo_hlcpp
  ```

### Examine the FIDL bindings

The `fidl()` GN target compiles the FIDL interface and generates additional
build targets to provide the bindings in various languages. To examine the
bindings, you must compile the individual targets.

Compile the `fidl.examples.routing.echo` bindings:

* {Rust}

  ```posix-terminal
  fx build vendor/fuchsia-codelab/echo-fidl:echo_rust
  ```

* {C++}

  ```posix-terminal
  fx build vendor/fuchsia-codelab/echo-fidl:echo_hlcpp
  ```

Use GN to locate the generated source files for the target and open them in an
editor:

* {Rust}

  ```posix-terminal
  fx gn desc out/default/ vendor/fuchsia-codelab/echo-fidl:echo_rust.actual sources
  ```

* {C++}

  ```posix-terminal
  fx gn desc out/default/ vendor/fuchsia-codelab/echo-fidl:echo_hlcpp sources
  ```

Explore the contents of these files. Below is a summary of some of the key
generated interfaces:

<aside class="key-point">
<b>Asynchronous vs. synchronous clients</b>
<p>The FIDL toolchain generates client bindings that are asynchronous by default.
This means the client methods return immediately to the caller and responses
are delivered using a callback or future. Synchronous clients provide a
simplified API that guarantees responses are delivered before the client
method returns.</p>

<p>Synchronous clients are not available in all supported languages. For more
details, see the specifications for your chosen language in the
<a href="/docs/reference/fidl/bindings/overview">Bindings Reference</a>.</d>
