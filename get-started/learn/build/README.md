# Building Fuchsia

Fuchsia is an open source effort that strives to be
[inclusive](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Google steers the direction of Fuchsia and makes platform decisions, but the
Fuchsia project encourages contributions from the entire community.
The [bug tracking system](/docs/contribute/report-issue.md) and
[mailing lists](/docs/contribute/community/get-involved.md) are public, and the
public [RFC process](/docs/contribute/governance/rfcs/README.md) provides a
consistent and transparent path for making project-wide, technical decisions.

Fuchsia code is covered under multiple open source licenses:

*   The Zircon kernel is released under an
    [MIT-style license](/zircon/kernel/LICENSE)
*   Fuchsia user space components are released under a
    [BSD-style license](/LICENSE)

Any code hosted within the project that has a different copyright holder or that
is released under a different license is considered external code.

Note: The complete list of approved licenses and policies regarding external
code is available in
[licensing policies](/docs/contribute/governance/policy/open-source-licensing-policies.md).
You can also learn more about contributing to Fuchsia in the
[governance guidelines](/docs/contribute/governance/governance.md).

Contributing to an open source project begins with understanding how to navigate
and build the code. In this training module, you will learn more about the
Fuchsia open source tree and successfully complete your first build of a Fuchsia
product.
