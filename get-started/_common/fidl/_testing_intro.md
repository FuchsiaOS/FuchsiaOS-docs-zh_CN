[Integration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing){:.external}
focuses on validating your component's behavior as it interacts with other
components on the system. Because of this, integration tests are typically built
separately from the main component and may declare the component under test
and other dependencies as children. Depending on the nature of the test,
dependency components may be provided as mocks or stubs to promote that the test
cases remain hermetic.

[集成测试](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing){:.external} 侧重于验证组件的行为，因为它会与系统上其他组件进行交互。正因为如此，集成测试通常与主组件分开构建，并且可能将被测组件和其他依赖组件声明为子组件。根据测试的性质，依赖组件可以作为模拟（mock）或存根（stub）提供，以促进测试用例保持封闭性。
