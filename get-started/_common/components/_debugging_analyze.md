## Analyzing crashes

Fuchsia starts a program at boot called `crashanalyzer` that reports program
crashes and prints a backtrace of the crashing thread to the system log. While
you can explore these directly by reviewing the logs at runtime, the backtrace
content is encoded using the stack memory address references rather than
pointing to the corresponding lines in the program source files.

This is because the **debug symbols** are stripped out of the core binaries
by default at build time. To properly analyze the crash log, you need to
reapply those symbols to the backtrace to see the call stack in terms of source
code line numbers. When you call the `ffx log` command, the developer tools
process the raw log through an additional binary called `symbolizer` that
reapplies the symbols from your local build configuration to any backtraces in
the log.

```posix-terminal
ffx log
```

The output you see includes the symbols reapplied to the backtrace:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
[klog][I] devmgr: crash_analyzer_listener: analyzing exception type 0x108
... same output as "raw" backtrace ...

```

<aside class="key-point">
If you have a manually captured backtrace, you can run the same process by
passing the content through the <code>ffx debug symbolize</code> command.
</aside>

With a properly symbolized backtrace, you can directly discover the site of a
crash in your source code.

### Step-through debugging

Just knowing where a program crashed may not be enough information to fully
diagnose the issue. Sometimes it's necessary to walk through the code
step-by-step and even inspect the state of variables in memory. To support this,
Fuchsia has a debugger for core code called `zxdb`.

The `zxdb` tool is a client that connects to a running `debug_agent` component
on the target device. You can use the `zxdb` commands to configure the
`debug_agent` to attach to specific processes and set breakpoints. Once a debug
session is attached to a running process, `zxdb` allows you to step through the
code and inspect the stack frames.

![Diagram showing how the Fuchsia debugger (zxdb) interacts with the
debug_agent service running on a Fuchsia device to perform interactive
debugging of a process.](/get-started/images/components/zxdb.png){: width="591"}

Setting up the debug session requires the following high-level steps:

1.  Run the `debug_agent` component on the target device.
1.  Run the `zxdb` client and connect to the target device.
1.  Set the location for `zxdb` to find debug symbols.

The simplest method to start a debug session is to use the `ffx debug connect`
command, which does all of these in the context of your local Fuchsia build.
However, these steps can also be performed manually if you need to configure
them separately.

Once the debug session is active, you are taken to a `[zxdb]` prompt to issue
debugger commands. You can use `zxdb` to configure the `debug_agent` to attach
to a process using a name filter and set pending breakpoints even if no
matching process is currently running.

The following example sets a pending breakpoint on main to stop at the
beginning of execution, and waits for a process called "hello-world" to start:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
[zxdb] attach hello-world
Waiting for process matching "hello-world"

[zxdb] break main
Breakpoint 1 (Software) on Global, Enabled, stop=All, @ main
Pending: No matches for location, it will be pending library loads.
```

<aside class="caution">
  <b>Launching components with zxdb</b>
  <p>The Fuchsia debugger supports two main methods of debugging a process:
  <code>run</code> and <code>attach</code>. Avoid using <code>run</code> to
  start and debug components.</p>

  <p>When the debugger launches a component, the component will have the same
  capabilities as the <code>debug_agent</code>. The only way to get the correct
  environment is to launch your component in the way it expects and attach the
  debugger to it.</p>
</aside>

Once the debugger is attached to a process, you can use `zxdb` commands to
control and inspect the state of the process. Here is a short collection of
common commands:

Note: For complete details and reference on `zxdb` commands, see
[The Fuchsia debugger](/development/debugger).
