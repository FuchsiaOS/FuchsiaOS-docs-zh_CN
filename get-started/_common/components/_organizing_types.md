## Capability types

Fuchsia components support many different types of capabilities. So far in this
module, the examples have showcased two distinct capability types: `runner` and
`protocol`. You may have noticed that the `protocol` capability requires a
routing path but the `runner` capability does not.

Some capabilities are **explicitly routed** to components by their parent, while
others are provided to all components **within the same realm** using
**environments**. Environments enable the framework to provision capabilities
that don't make sense to route explicitly on a per-component basis. By default,
a component inherits the environment of its parent. Components may also declare
a new environment for their children.

The following table lists the capability types available to components,
and whether they must be explicitly routed from the parent component or
provided by the environment:
