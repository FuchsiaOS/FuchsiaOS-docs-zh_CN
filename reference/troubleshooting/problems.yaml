 use-case: |
   I want to understand what my component is doing at runtime.
 tools:
   - Inspect
   - Logs
   - Structured Logs
 description: |
   It is often useful to be able to look at what you component is actually doing when it runs on a
   system. Fuchsia, like most systems, supports [Logging][Logs] so components may
   provide human-readable output on their state. Logs may be augmented with
   [Structured Data][Structured Logs] that is typed and can be aggregated by other tools.

   Fuchsia components have the unique ability to [publish their ongoing state for inspection using
   the Inspect feature][Inspect]. Generally, Inspect tells you what your component is doing
   <i>right now</i> while Logs tell you how you got there. Both are useful to have a comprehensive
   view of component status.
