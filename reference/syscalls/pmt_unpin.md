# zx_pmt_unpin

## Summary

Unpin pages and revoke device access to them.

## Declaration

```c
#include <zircon/syscalls.h>

zx_status_t zx_pmt_unpin(zx_handle_t handle);
```

## Description

`zx_pmt_unpin()` unpins pages that were previously pinned by [`zx_bti_pin()`],
and revokes the access that was granted by the pin call.

Always consumes *handle*. It is invalid to use *handle* afterwards, including
to call [`zx_handle_close()`] on it.

## Rights

## Return value

On success, `zx_pmt_unpin()` returns **ZX_OK**.
In the event of failure, a negative error value is returned.

## Errors

**ZX_ERR_BAD_HANDLE**  *handle* is not a valid handle.

**ZX_ERR_WRONG_TYPE**  *handle* is not a PMT handle.
