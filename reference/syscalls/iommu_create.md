# zx_iommu_create

## Summary

Create a new IOMMU object in the kernel.

## Declaration

```c
#include <zircon/syscalls.h>

zx_status_t zx_iommu_create(zx_handle_t resource,
                            uint32_t type,
                            const void* desc,
                            size_t desc_size,
                            zx_handle_t* out);
```

## Description

`zx_iommu_create()` creates a new object in the kernel representing an IOMMU device.

The value of *type* determines the interpretation of *desc*.  See below for
details about the values of *type*.

Upon success, a handle for the new IOMMU is returned.  This handle will have rights
**ZX_RIGHT_DUPLICATE** and **ZX_RIGHT_TRANSFER**.

### *type* = **ZX_IOMMU_TYPE_DUMMY**

This type represents a no-op IOMMU.  It provides no hardware-level protections
against unauthorized access to memory.  It does allow pinning of physical memory
pages, to prevent the reuse of a page until the driver using the page says it is
done with it.

*desc* must be a valid pointer to a value of type `zx_iommu_desc_dummy_t`.
*desc_size* must be `sizeof(zx_iommu_desc_dummy_t)`.

## Rights

*resource* must have resource kind **ZX_RSRC_KIND_ROOT**.

## Return value

`zx_iommu_create()` returns **ZX_OK** and a handle to the new IOMMU
(via *out*) on success.  In the event of failure, a negative error value
is returned.

## Errors

**ZX_ERR_BAD_HANDLE**  *resource* is not a valid handle.

**ZX_ERR_WRONG_TYPE**  *resource* is not a resource handle.

**ZX_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED**  *resource* handle does not have sufficient privileges.

**ZX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED** *type* is not a defined value or is not
supported on this system.

**ZX_ERR_INVALID_ARGS**  *desc_size* is larger than **ZX_IOMMU_MAX_DESC_LEN**,
*desc* is an invalid pointer, *out* is an invalid pointer, or the contents of
*desc* are not valid for the given *type*.

**ZX_ERR_NO_MEMORY**  Failure due to lack of memory.
There is no good way for userspace to handle this (unlikely) error.
In a future build this error will no longer occur.
