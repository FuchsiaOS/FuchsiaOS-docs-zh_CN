# zx_event_create

## Summary

Create an event.

## Declaration

```c
#include <zircon/syscalls.h>

zx_status_t zx_event_create(uint32_t options, zx_handle_t* out);
```

## Description

`zx_event_create()` creates an event, which is an object that is signalable. That
is, its **ZX_USER_SIGNAL_n** (where *n* is 0 through 7) signals can be
manipulated using [`zx_object_signal()`].

The newly-created handle will have the [basic
rights](/docs/concepts/kernel/rights.md#zx_rights_basic) plus **ZX_RIGHT_SIGNAL**.

## Rights

Caller job policy must allow **ZX_POL_NEW_EVENT**.

## Return value

`zx_event_create()` returns **ZX_OK** and a valid event handle (via *out*) on success.
On failure, an error value is returned.

## Errors

**ZX_ERR_INVALID_ARGS**  *out* is an invalid pointer, or *options* is nonzero.

**ZX_ERR_NO_MEMORY**  Failure due to lack of memory.
There is no good way for userspace to handle this (unlikely) error.
In a future build this error will no longer occur.
