```c
#include <zircon/syscalls.h>

zx_status_t zx_profile_create(zx_handle_t root_job,
                              uint32_t options,
                              const zx_profile_info_t* profile,
                              zx_handle_t* out);
```

## DESCRIPTION

`zx_profile_create()` creates a new [profile](/reference/kernel_objects/profile.md) object.

The parameter *profile* specifies the settings in the profile, which in turn
will be applied to threads when [`zx_object_set_profile()`] is called. The
fields of *profile* are shown below. *options* must be zero.

```c
#define ZX_PROFILE_INFO_FLAG_PRIORITY (1 << 0)
#define ZX_PROFILE_INFO_FLAG_CPU_MASK (1 << 1)

typedef struct zx_profile_info {
  // A bitmask of ZX_PROFILE_INFO_FLAG_* values. Specifies which fields
  // below have been specified. Other fields are considered unset.
  uint32_t flags;

  // Scheduling priority. |flags| must have ZX_PROFILE_INFO_FLAG_PRIORITY set.
  int32_t priority;

  // CPUs that threads may be scheduled on. |flags| must have
  // ZX_PROFILE_INFO_FLAG_CPU_MASK set.
  zx_cpu_set_t cpu_affinity_mask;
} zx_profile_info_t;
```

The `flags` field specifies which fields in the `zx_profile_info_t` structure
contain valid values. Values in fields without a corresponding `flag` bit set
will be ignored. This allows fields with values of `0` and unset fields to be
distinguished, even if additional fields are added in future.

Upon success a handle for the new profile is returned.

## RIGHTS

<!-- Contents of this heading updated by update-docs-from-fidl, do not edit. -->

*root_job* must be of type **ZX_OBJ_TYPE_JOB** and have **ZX_RIGHT_MANAGE_PROCESS**.

Caller job policy must allow **ZX_POL_NEW_PROFILE**.

## RETURN VALUE

Returns **ZX_OK** and a handle to the new profile (via *out*) on success. In the
event of failure, a negative error value is returned.

## ERRORS

**ZX_ERR_BAD_HANDLE**  *root_job* is not a valid handle.

**ZX_ERR_WRONG_TYPE**  *root_job* is not a job handle.

**ZX_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED**  *root_job* does not have **ZX_RIGHT_MANAGE_PROCESS**
right, or *root_job* is not a handle to the root job.

**ZX_ERR_INVALID_ARGS**  One or more of the arguments provided were invalid:

  * *profile* or *out* was an invalid pointer
  * *flags* contains an unknown option
  * *options* was not zero
  * *priority* was an invalid priority

**ZX_ERR_NO_MEMORY**  Failure due to lack of memory.
