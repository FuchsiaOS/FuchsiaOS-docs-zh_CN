# zx_restricted_enter

## Summary

Enter restricted mode

## Declaration

```c
#include <zircon/syscalls-next.h>

zx_status_t zx_restricted_enter(uint32_t options,
                                uintptr_t vector_table_ptr,
                                uintptr_t context);
```

## Description

Enters restricted mode from normal thread state. If successful, the current
thread will return to normal mode via an entry point passed in
*vector_table_ptr*.

*vector_table_ptr* must be within the current user address space.
*context* may be any value. It is used as a value to pass back to normal
mode when returning from restricted mode.

*options* must be zero.

Arguments to the function at *vector_table_ptr* are architecturally specific:

On x64, *context* is placed in *rdi* and an exception code is played in *rsi*.
All other registers are currently undefined, including the stack pointer.

ARM64 support is currently unimplemented.

Currently, the *exception code* passed back to normal mode is always 0.

### Shared process

Processes created with the `ZX_PROCESS_SHARED` option, or via `zx_process_create_shared()`
have two distinct [address spaces]. One is shared between multiple processes, while the other
is restricted to the specific process. When a thread that is entering restrcited mode
belongs to such a process, the active address space for the thread is updated as follows:

  - When entering restricted mode the active address space for the thread is set to the
    restricted address space of the process.
  - When exiting restricted mode the active address space for the thread is set to the
    shared address space of the process.

## Rights

None (currently)

## Return value

No return value on success, since the current thread indirectly returns via
*vector_table_ptr*. In the event of failure, a negative error value is returned.

## Errors

**ZX_ERR_INVALID_ARGS** *vector_table_ptr* is not a valid user address or *options*
is non-zero.

**ZX_ERR_BAD_STATE** restricted mode register state is invalid.
