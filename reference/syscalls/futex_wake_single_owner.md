# zx_futex_wake_single_owner

## Summary

Wake one thread waiting on a futex, and set the ownership of the futex to that thread.

zx_status_t zx_futex_wake_single_owner(const zx_futex_t* value_ptr);
```

## Description

Wake one thread waiting on a futex.
If a thread is woken, ownership of the futex is transferred to that thread. If no
thread is woken (because none are waiting), ownership of the futex is set to none.

See [`zx_futex_wake()`] for a full description.

## Rights

None.

## Return value

`zx_futex_wake_single_owner()` returns **ZX_OK** on success.

## Errors

**ZX_ERR_INVALID_ARGS**  *value_ptr* is not aligned.
