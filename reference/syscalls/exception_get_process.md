# zx_exception_get_process

## Summary

Create a handle for the exception's process.

## Declaration

```c
#include <zircon/syscalls.h>

zx_status_t zx_exception_get_process(zx_handle_t handle, zx_handle_t* out);
```

## Description

The exception process is only available for job and process exception channels,
thread exceptions cannot access their parent process handles.

*handle* is the exception handle.

*out* will be filled with a new handle to the exception process. This handle
will have the same rights as the task given to
[`zx_task_create_exception_channel()`].

## Rights

*handle* must be of type **ZX_OBJ_TYPE_EXCEPTION**.

## Return value

`zx_exception_get_process()` returns **ZX_OK** on success.
In the event of failure, a negative error value is returned.

## Errors

**ZX_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED** *handle* was received via a thread exception channel.

**ZX_ERR_BAD_HANDLE** *handle* is not a valid handle.

**ZX_ERR_NO_MEMORY**  Failed to allocate memory for a new handle.

**ZX_ERR_WRONG_TYPE**  *handle* is not an exception.
