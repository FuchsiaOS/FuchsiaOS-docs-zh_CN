# FIDL bindings specification

This document is a specification of Fuchsia Interface Definition Language
(**FIDL**) bindings. It is meant to provide guidance and best practices for
bindings authors, and recommend specific approaches for their ergonomic use.

In this document, the following keywords are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC2119][RFC2119]: **MAY**, **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **OPTIONAL**,
**RECOMMENDED**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD
NOT**.

## Generated code indication

A comment must be placed at the top of machine-generated code to indicate it is
machine generated. For languages with a standard on how to indicate generated
sources (as opposed to human-written code), that standard must be followed.

In [Go][go-generated-code-comment] for instance, generated sources must be
marked with a comment following the pattern

```go
// Code generated by <tool>; DO NOT EDIT.
```

## Scoping

It is RECOMMENDED to namespace machine-generated code to avoid clashing with
user-defined symbols. This can be implement using scoping constructs provided by
the language, like namespaces in C++, modules in Rust, or packages in Go and
Dart. If the generated scope can have a name, it SHOULD be named using
components of the name of the FIDL library that contains the definitions for the
generated code, which allows each FIDL library to exist in a unique scope. In
cases where scoping is not possible and the namespace is shared, some processing
of the generated names (see [Naming](#naming)) may be necessary.

## Naming {#naming}

In general, the names used in the generated code SHOULD match the names used in
the FIDL definition. Possible exceptions are listed in the following sections.

### Casing

Casing changes SHOULD be made to fit the idiomatic style of the language (e.g.
using snake_case or CamelCase). `fidlc` will ensure that identifier uniqueness
is enforced taking into account potential casing differences (see [RFC-0040][rfc0040]).

### Reserved keywords and name clashes

The generated code MUST take into account the reserved keywords in the target
language to avoid unexpected when a keyword from the target language is used in
the FIDL definition. An example scheme would be to prefix conflicting names with
an underscore `_` (assuming no keywords begin with an underscore).

The generated code MUST avoid generating code that causes naming conflicts. For
example, in a function whose parameters are generated based on a FIDL
definition, it MUST be impossible for the names of the local variables in the
generated to clash with possible generated names.

## Ordinals

### Method ordinals

Ordinals used for methods are large 64-bit numbers. Bindings SHOULD emit these
ordinals in hexadecimal, i.e. `0x60e700e002995ef8`, not `6982550709377523448`.

### Union, and table ordinals

Ordinals used for `union` and `table` start at 1, and must form a dense space.
Therefore, these numbers are typically small, and bindings SHOULD emit these
ordinals in decimal notation.

## Native types

It is RECOMMENDED that bindings use the most specific and ergonomic native types
where possible when converting built-in FIDL types to native types in the target
language. For example, the Dart bindings use `Int32List` to represent a
`vector<int32>:N` and `array<int32>:N` rather than the more generic `List<int>`.

## Generated types and values

### Constant support

Generated code MUST generate variables containing matching values for each
`const` definition in the corresponding FIDL. These variables SHOULD be marked
as immutable in languages that support this (e.g. `const` in C++, Rust, and Go,
or `final` in Dart).

### Bits support

Bindings MUST provide generated values for each bits member. They MAY also
generate values representing the bits with no flags set, as well as the bits
with every flag set (the "bits mask"). These values SHOULD be scoped to each set
of bits.

It is RECOMMENDED to support the following operators over generated values:

* bitwise and, i.e `&`
* bitwise or, i.e `|`
* bitwise exclusive-or, i.e `^`
* bitwise not, i.e `~`

To provide bitwise operations that always result in valid bits values,
implementations of bitwise not should further mask the resulting value with the
mask of all values. In pseudo code:

```
~value1   means   mask & ~bits_of(value1)
```

This mask value is provided in the [JSON IR][jsonir] for convenience.

In languages where operator overloading is supported, such as C++, bitwise
negation MUST be implemented by overloading the built in operator in a manner
that always unsets the unknown members of the bitfield.  In languages that do
not support operator overloading, such as Go, values SHOULD provide an
`InvertBits()` method (cased in the manner most appropriate for the language)
for executing the masked inversion.

Bindings SHOULD NOT support other operators since they could result in invalid
bits value (or risk a non-obvious translation of their meaning), e.g.:

* bitwise shifts, i.e `<<` or `>>`
* bitwise unsigned shift, i.e `>>>`

For cases where the generated code includes a type wrapping the underlying
numeric bits value, it SHOULD be possible to convert between the raw value and
the wrapper type. It is RECOMMENDED for this conversion to be explicit.

Bindings MAY provide functions for converting a primitive value of the underlying
type of a `bits` to the `bits` type itself. These converters may be of several
flavors:

* Possibly failing (or returning null) if the input value contains any unknown
  bits.
* Truncates any unknown bits from the input value.
* For [flexible](#strict-flexible) bits only: Keeps any unknown bits from the input value.

#### Unknown data {#unknown-bits}

For [flexible](#strict-flexible) bits:

* Bindings MUST provide methods for checking if the value contains any unknown
  bits, and additionally MAY provide methods for retrieving those unknown bits.
* The bitwise not operator unsets all unknown members, regardless of
  their previous values (but works as expected for known members). The
  other bitwise operators retain the same semantics for unknown bits members as
  for known members.

Strict bits MAY provide the above APIs as well in order to simplify [transitions
betwen strict and flexible][source-compatible].

In some languages, it is difficult or impossible to prevent users from
manually creating an instance of a `bits` type from a primitive, therefore
preventing bindings designers from restricting strict bits values to having a
properly restricted domain. In this case, bindings authors SHOULD provide the
unknown data related APIs for strict bits.

In languages with compile-checked deprecation warnings such as Rust, the unknown
data related APIs SHOULD be provided for strict bits but marked as deprecated.

### Enum support

Bindings MUST provide generated values for each enum member. These values SHOULD
be scoped to each enum.

For cases where the generated code includes a type wrapping the underlying
numeric enum value, it SHOULD be possible to convert between the raw value and
the wrapper type. It is RECOMMENDED for this conversion to be explicit.

#### Unknown data {#unknown-enums}

For [flexible](#strict-flexible) enums:

* Bindings MUST provide a way for users to determine if an enum is unknown,
  including making it possible to match against the enum (for
  languages that support `switch`, `match`, or similar constructs).
* Bindings MAY expose the (possibly unknown) underlying raw value of the enum.
* Bindings MUST provide a way to obtain a valid unknown enum, without the
  user needing to provide an explicit unknown raw primitive value. If one of the
  enum members is annotated with the [`[Unknown]`][unknown-attr] attribute,
  then this unknown enum constructor MUST use the value of the annotated
  member. Otherwise, the value used by the unknown constructor is unspecified.
* The `[Unknown]` member MUST be treated as unknown in any
  function that determines whether a value is unknown.

### Struct support

Bindings MUST provide a type for each struct that supports the following
operations:

* Construction with explicit values for each member.
* Reading and writing members.

Bindings MAY support default values for structs. The default values are
specified in the [JSON IR][jsonir].

### Union support

Bindings MUST provide a type for each union that supports the following
operations:

* Construction with an explicit variant set. It is NOT RECOMMENDED for bindings
  to offer construction without a variant. This should be considered only for
  performance reasons or due to limitations of the target language.
* Reading/writing the variant of the union and the data associated with that
  variant.

For languages without union types or union value literals, it is RECOMMENDED to
support factory methods for constructing new unions given a value for one of the
possible variants. For example, in a C like language, this would allow replacing
code like:

```C
my_union_t foo;
foo.set_variant(bar);
do_stuff(foo);
```

with something like:

```C
do_stuff(my_union_with_variant(bar));
```

These factory methods SHOULD be named as "[Type]-with-[Variant]", cased properly
for the target language.

Examples of this exist for the
[HLCPP](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/309246/) and
[Go](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/313205/) bindings.

#### Unknown data {#unknown-unions}

For [flexible unions](#strict-flexible):

* Bindings MAY provide a constructor to create a union with an unknown variant
  with specified ordinal, bytes, and handles.
  * Such a constructor is useful not just for testing the bindings, but also for
    end-developer testing needs (e.g. to check that unknown data is handled
    correctly in a proxy).
  * Having a constructor also prevents end-developers from constructing unions
    with unknown variants in roundabout ways, such as by manually decoding raw
    bytes.
  * Usage of this constructor is discouraged in production code.
* Bindings MUST provide a way to determine whether the union has an unknown
  variant.
* Bindings MAY provide getters and setters for the unknown variant,
  similar to methods generated for the union's known variants.

### Table support

Bindings MUST provide a type for each table that supports the following
operations:

* Construction where specifying values for each member is optional.
* Reading and writing each member, including checking whether a given member is
  set. These SHOULD follow the naming scheme: `get_[member]`, `set_[member]`,
  and `has_[member]`, cased properly for the target language.

Bindings MAY support default values for tables. The default values are specified
in the [JSON IR][jsonir].

Bindings MAY provide constructors for tables that only require specifying values
for fields that have a value. For example, in Rust this can be accomplished
using the `::empty()` constructor along with struct update syntax. Supporting
construction this ways allows users to write code that is robust against
addition of new fields to the table.

#### Unknown data {#unknown-tables}

All tables are [flexible](#strict-flexible).

Bindings MUST provide a way to determine whether the table included any
unknown fields during decoding.

For bindings that store the unknown data in the decoded value,
bindings MAY provide a way for users to read and write the unknown ordinals,
bytes, and handles. Being able to modify the unknown data is useful for
testing, but should be discouraged in production code.

### Strict and flexible types {#strict-flexible}

Examples of FIDL types and their corresponding unknown data include:

FIDL Type | Unknown Data | Unknown Data Type
----------|--------------|-------------------
union | unknown variant | ordinal, bytes, and handles
table | unknown fields | map from ordinal to corresponding bytes and handles
enum | unknown variant | same as the underlying type of the `enum`
bits | unknown bits | same as the underlying type of the `bits`

Strict types MUST fail to decode when encountering any unknown data.
Flexible types MUST succeed when decoding a value with unknown data (with
one exception, see [value types and resource types](#value-resource)).

In general, the underlying unknown data can either be discarded during decoding,
or be stored within the decoded type. In either case, the type SHOULD indicate
whether it encountered unknown data or not when decoding.
If the unknown data is stored, bindings MAY provide ways for the user to
access this data, though bindings SHOULD either provide access to all of the
parts of the unknown data (e.g. for unions and tables: handles, bytes, and
ordinals) or to none of them. Refer to the
[enum support](#unknown-enums), [bits support](#unknown-bits),
[union support](#unknown-unions), and [table support](#unknown-tables) sections
for specific guidance on the design of these APIs.

If any part of the unknown data is discarded, the decoded value SHOULD
fail to re-encode rather than send a message with missing data. On the other
hand, if all of the unknown data is stored, the decoded value SHOULD
support re-encoding back onto the wire.

Bindings authors SHOULD favor optimizing `strict` types, possibly at the expense
of `flexible` types. For example, if there is a design tradeoff between the two,
bindings authors SHOULD prefer optimizing the `strict` types.

Changing a type from strict to flexible MUST be [transitionable][soft-transitions].

### Value types and resource types {#value-resource}

Value types MUST NOT contain handles, and resource types MAY contain
handles.

In the interaction between value types and flexible types, the requirements of
the value type supersedes the requirements of the flexible type when they are
in conflict. In other words, in the case where:

* a type stores unknown data, and encounters handles in the unknown data during
  decoding, and
* the type is value type.

decoding MUST fail.

## Protocol support

### Error types

It is OPTIONAL that bindings provide some form of special support for protocol
methods with an error type matching the idiomatic way errors are handled in the
target language.

For example, languages that provide some form of a "result" type (i.e. a union
type that contains a "success" variant and an "error" variant), such as Rust's
`result::Result`, or `fit::result` in C++ MAY provide automatic conversions to
and from these types when receiving or sending method responses with an error
type.

Languages with exceptions can have the generated protocol method code optionally
raise an exception corresponding to the error type.

In cases where this is not possible, the generated code MAY provide convenience
functions for responding directly with a successful response or error value, or
for receiving an error type response, in order avoid boilerplate user code for
initializing result unions.

## Error handling

Protocols MAY surface transport errors back to the user. Transport errors can be
categorized as errors encountered when converting between the native type and
the wire format data, or as errors from the underlying transport mechanism (for
example, an error obtained from calling `zx_channel_write`). These errors MAY
consist of the error status, as well as any other diagnostics information.

## Iovec Support

Bindings may optionally use the vectorized `zx_channel_write_etc` and
`zx_channel_call_etc` syscalls. When these are used, the first iovec entry MUST
be present and large enough to hold the FIDL
[transactional message header](/docs/reference/fidl/language/wire-format#transactional-messages)
(16 bytes).

### Attributes

Bindings MUST support the following [attributes][attributes]:

* `[Transitional]`

## Best practices

### Alternative output

It is OPTIONAL for bindings to provide alternative output methods to the FIDL
wire format.

One type of output could be user-friendly debug printing for the generated
types. For example, printing a value of the bits:

```fidl
{%includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="examples/fidl/fuchsia.examples.docs/misc.test.fidl" region_tag="mode" %}
```

could print the string `"Mode.Read | Mode.Write"` rather than the raw value
`"0b11"`.

Similar user-friendly printing can be implemented for each of the generated FIDL
types.

### Message memory allocation

Bindings MAY provide the option for users to provide their own memory to use
when sending or receiving messages, which allows the user to control memory
allocation.

### Wire format memory layout

Bindings MAY have the in memory layout of the generated FIDL types match the
wire format of the type. Doing this can in theory avoid extra copies, as the
data can be used directly as the transactional message, or vice versa. In
practice, sending a FIDL message may still involve a copying step where the
components of a message are assembled into a contiguous chunk of memory (called
"linearization"). The downside of such an approach is that it makes the bindings
more rigid: changes to the FIDL wire format become more complex to implement.

The [LLCPP bindings][llcpp] are the only binding that take this
approach.

### Equality comparison

For aggregate types such as structs, tables, and unions, bindings MAY provide
equality operators that perform a deep comparison on two instances of the same
type. These operators SHOULD NOT be provided for resource types (see RFC-0057) as
comparison of handles is not possible. Avoiding exposing equality operators for
resource types prevents source breakages caused by an equality operation
'disappearing' when a handle is added to the type.

### Copying

For aggregate types such as structs, tables, and unions, bindings MAY provide
functionality for copying instances of these types. Copying SHOULD NOT be
provided for resource types (see [RFC-0057][rfc0057]) as making copies of handles
is not guaranteed to succeed. Avoiding exposing copy operators for resource
types prevents source breakages caused by a copy operation 'disappearing' or
having its signature change when a handle is added to the type.

### Test utilities

It is OPTIONAL for bindings to generate additional code specifically to be used
during testing. For example, the bindings can generate stub implementations of
each protocol so that users only need too verride specific methods that are
going to be exercised in a test.

### Epitaphs

Bindings SHOULD provide support for epitaphs, i.e. generated code that allows
servers to send epitaphs and clients to receive and handle epitaphs.

### Setters and Getters

Bindings MAY provide setters and getters for fields on aggregate types (structs,
unions, and tables). Even in languages where getter/setter methods are
un-idiomatic, using these methods will allow renaming internal field names
without breaking usages of that field.

### Request "responders"

When implementing a FIDL protocol using the FIDL bindings in a target language,
the bindings provide an API to read the request parameters, and a way to write
the response parameters, if any. For example, the request parameters could be
provided as the arguments to a function, and the response parameters could be
provided as the return type of the function.

For a FIDL protocol:

```fidl
{%includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="examples/fidl/fuchsia.examples.docs/misc.test.fidl" region_tag="hasher" %}
```

A binding might generate:

```typescript
// Users would implement this interface to provide an implementation of the
// Hasher FIDL protocol
interface Hasher {
  // Respond to the request by returning the desired response
  hash: (value: string): Uint8Array;
};
```

Bindings MAY provide a responder object that is used to write
responses. In the example above, this would mean passing an additional
responder object in the function arguments, and having the function return void:

```typescript
interface Hasher {
  hash: (value: string, responder: HashResponder): void;
};

interface HashResponder {
  sendResponse(value: Uint8Array);
};
```

The use of a responder object has the following benefits:

* Improved ergonomics: responders can be used to provide any type of
  interaction with the client. For example, responders can have methods that
  close the channel with an epitaph, or provide APIs for sending events. For
  two-way methods, the responder could provide the mechanism to send a response.
* Increased flexibility: encapsulating all these behaviors in a single type
  makes it possible to add or remove behavior from the bindings without
  making breaking changes to bindings users, by only changing the responder
  object, and not the protocol object.

When providing a responder object, bindings should be careful about responders
being invoked on a different thread than the one the request was processed on.
Responders may also be invoked much later than the request was processed, for
instance when implement a handing get pattern. In practice this could be
implemented by allowing users to move ownership of the responder out of the
request handler class, e.g. into a callback for an asynchronous function.

The object MAY NOT necessarily be called responder. For example, it could have
a different name depending on whether the method is fire and forget or two way:

```typescript
interface Hasher {
  // the Hash method is a two-way method, so the object is called a responder
  hash: (value: string, responder: HashResponder): void;
  // the SetSeed method is a fire and forget method, so it gets a different name
  setSeed: (seed: number, control: HasherControlHandle): void;
}
```
