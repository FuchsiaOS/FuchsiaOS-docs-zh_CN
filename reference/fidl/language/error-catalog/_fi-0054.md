## fi-0054: Invalid bits/enum member {:#fi-0054}

This error occurs when an `enum` or `bits` member is referenced without being previously defined.

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0054.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

To avoid this error, confirm that you have previously declared a value for the referenced
member value. These values are case sensitive.
