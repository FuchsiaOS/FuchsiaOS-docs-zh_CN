## fi-0145: Attribute typo {:#fi-0145}

An attribute name whose spelling is too similar to one of FIDL's official
[attributes][docs-fidl-attributes] will result in a compiler warning:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0145.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

In the above example, the attribute `@duc` is too similar in spelling to the
official FIDL attribute `@doc`. In cases like this, the attribute naming is
intentional, and not an accidental misspelling of an official FIDL attribute, it
should be modified to be sufficiently unique:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0145.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Besides spell checking, the purpose of this warning is to discourage using
names that are too similar to official FIDL attributes.

The typo detection algorithm works by calculating the [edit
distance][wiki-edit-distance] of the attribute name from every official FIDL
attribute. Names that are too similar, defined as having too small of an edit
distance, trigger the typo detector.
