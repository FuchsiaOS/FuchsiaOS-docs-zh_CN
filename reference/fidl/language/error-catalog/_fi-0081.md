## fi-0081: Duplicate method ordinal {:#fi-0081}

This error usually occurs when you use an [`@selector` attribute][81-selector]
to make two method names produce the same ordinal.

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0081.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

To fix this issue, update either the method names, or selectors to not collide.

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0081.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

This error can also happen if there is a SHA-256 collision, but the chances of
this are basically zero. If you are positive your selectors aren't at fault and
you still run into this error, you've probably found a bug in the FIDL compiler.
Please report the issue to [our issue tracker] if this happens.
