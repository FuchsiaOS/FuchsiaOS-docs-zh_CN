## fi-0108: Duplicate resource property name {:#fi-0108}

A `resource_definition` declaration's properties must not repeat names:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0108.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

The correct rendering of this declaration has exactly one `subtype` property and
zero or one `rights` properties:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0108.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

This is an error related to FIDL's internal implementation, and thus should only
ever be surfaced to developers working on FIDL's core libraries. End users
should never see this error.

The `resource_definition` declaration it refers to is FIDL's internal means of
defining resources like handles, and is likely to change in the future as part
of the [handle generalization](https://fxbug.dev/64629) effort.
