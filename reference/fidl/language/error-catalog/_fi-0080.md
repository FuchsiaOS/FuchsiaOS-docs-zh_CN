## fi-0080: Generated zero value ordinal {:#fi-0080}

This error should never occur. If you managed to make it happen,
congratulations, you've probably broken SHA-256!

Joking aside, this error occurs if the fidlc compiler generates an ordinal value
of 0. It should never happen, so if it does, you've probably found a bug in the
FIDL compiler. Please report the issue to [our issue tracker] if this happens.
