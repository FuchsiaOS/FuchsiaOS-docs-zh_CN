## fi-0041: Multiple libraries with same name {:#fi-0041}

Each library passed to `fidlc` must have a unique name:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0041-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0041-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Ensure that all libraries have unique names:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0041-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0041-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

This error is often caused by arguments being supplied to `fidlc` in an
incorrect manner. The constituent files that make up each library necessary for
compilation (that is, the library being compiled and all of its transitive
dependencies) must be supplied as a single space-separated list of files passed
via the `--files` argument, with one such flag per library. A common mistake is
to try to pass the file for all libraries in a single `--files` list.
