## fi-0123: Duplicate canonical attribute name {:#fi-0123}

An element cannot have multiple attributes with the same canonical name:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0123.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Even though `custom_attribute` and `CustomAttribute` look different, they are
both represented by the **canonical** name `custom_attribute`. You get the
canonical name by converting the original name to `snake_case`.

To fix the error, give each attribute a name that is unique after
canonicalization.

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0123.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

See [fi-0035](#fi-0035) for more details on why FIDL requires declarations to
have unique canonical names.
