## fi-0099: Duplicate canonical union member names {:#fi-0099}

Canonical variant names used for members in a `union` declaration cannot be
repeated:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0099.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Even though `myVariant` and `MyVariant` look different, they are both
represented by the **canonical** name `my_variant`. You get the canonical name
by converting the original name to `snake_case`.

To fix the error, give each member a name that is unique after
canonicalization:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0099-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Alternatively, one of the members with the duplicated name can be removed:

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0099-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

See [fi-0035](#fi-0035) for more details on why FIDL requires declarations to
have unique canonical names.
