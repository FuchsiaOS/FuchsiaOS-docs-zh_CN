## fi-0078: Duplicate method name {:#fi-0078}

Every method included in a protocol must be unique:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0078-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

This applies to composed method names as well:

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0078-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Change the offending name such that all names in the declaration, including ones
that are transitively composed in, are unique:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0078-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

In the case of composed protocols, it is usually best to change the name in the
composing protocol, rather than the composed one, since the latter is more
likely to be composed into other protocols as well. Changing the former results
in fewer APIs being impacted:

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0078-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```
