## fi-0077: Interaction payload cannot be empty struct {:#fi-0077}

The payloads in a method or event cannot be empty structs:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0077-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0077-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

If you would like to express that a particular request/response does not hold
any information, delete the empty struct, leaving `()` in that location:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0077-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0077-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Empty structs cannot be extended, and take 1 byte on the wire. Since FIDL
supports interactions without payloads, using empty structs this way is
superfluous and less efficient. Therefore they are not allowed.
