## fi-0036: Name overlap {:#fi-0036}

Declarations with the same name cannot have overlapping availabilities:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0036.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Instead, use the `@available` attribute to make sure only one of the
declarations is present at any given version:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0036.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Alternatively, rename or remove one of the declarations as shown in
[fi-0034](#fi-0034).
