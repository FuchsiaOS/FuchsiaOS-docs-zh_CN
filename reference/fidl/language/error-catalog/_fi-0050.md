## fi-0050: Deprecated struct default syntax prohibited {:#fi-0050}

Previously, FIDL allowed for default values to be set on `struct` members:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0050.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

As of [RFC-0160: Remove support for FIDL struct defaults][rfc-0160], this behavior is
disallowed:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0050.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Default values for `struct` members are no longer allowed. Users should set such
defaults in application logic instead.

A small number of legacy users of this syntax are allowed to continue using it
behind an allowlist built into the compiler, but no new exceptions are being
made to add to this list. As soon as these users are migrated off, this feature
will be permanently removed from FIDL.
