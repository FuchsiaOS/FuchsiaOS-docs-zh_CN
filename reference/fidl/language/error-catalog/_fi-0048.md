## fi-0048: Optional table member {:#fi-0048}

Table members types cannot be `optional`:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0048.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Remove the `optional` constraint from all members:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0048.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Table members are always optional, so specifying this fact on the member's underlying type is redundant.

Table members are always optional because, on the wire, each table member is represented as an entry in a vector.
This vector is always represents all known fields on the table, so every omitted table member is represented
as a null envelope - exactly equivalent to the representation of an omitted optional type.
