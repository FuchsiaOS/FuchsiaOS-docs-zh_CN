## fi-0022: Cannot attach attribute to identifier {:#fi-0022}

This error occurs when an attribute is placed on the the type of a declaration
when that type is an identifier type. For example, placing an attribute after
field name but before the field's type in a struct declaration associates the
attribute with the type of the field rather than with the field itself. If the
type of the field is a preexisting type being referenced by name, additional
attributes cannot be applied to it.

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0022.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

If the intent was to apply an attribute to the field, the attribute should be
moved before the field name.

Attributes can be applied to types where they are declared. This means that if
the type of a struct field or other similar declaration is an anonymous type
rather than an identifier type, attributes can be applied to the type.
