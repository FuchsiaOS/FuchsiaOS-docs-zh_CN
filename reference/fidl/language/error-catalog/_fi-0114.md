## fi-0114: Composed protocol is too open {:#fi-0114}

A protocol cannot compose another protocol that is more open than itself:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0114.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

You can fix this by increasing the openness of the composing protocol, i.e.
changing it from `closed` to `ajar` or from `ajar` to `open`:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0114-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Alternatively, you can reduce the openness of the composed protocol, i.e. change
it from `open` to `ajar` or from `ajar` to `closed`:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0114-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

This rule exists because the openness of a protocol restricts what kind of
methods it is allowed to contain. For example, an ajar protocol cannot contain
flexible two-way methods, but an open protocol can, so it's not safe for an ajar
protocol to compose an open protocol.
