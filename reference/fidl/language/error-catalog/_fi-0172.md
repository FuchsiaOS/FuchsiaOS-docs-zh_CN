## fi-0172: Resource definition must use uint32 subtype {:#fi-0172}

The subtype of a `resource_definition` declaration must be `uint32`:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0172.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Change the subtype to an `uint32` to fix this error:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0172.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

This is an error related to FIDL's internal implementation, and thus should only
ever be surfaced to developers working on FIDL's core libraries. End users
should never see this error.

The `resource_definition` declaration it refers to is FIDL's internal means of
defining resources like handles, and is likely to change in the future as part
of the [handle generalization](https://fxbug.dev/64629) effort.
