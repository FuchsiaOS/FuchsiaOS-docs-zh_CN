## fi-0119: Error syntax in events is deprecated {:#fi-0119}

Events used to allow the error syntax, but this is now deprecated:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

<!-- TODO(fxbug.dev/98319): Change bad library name back to "test.bad.fi0119".
     It can't start with "test." right now or it evades the deprecation error. -->
```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0119.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Instead, specify the event without an error:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0119-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Alternatively, model the error as a union instead:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0119-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Using the error syntax with events was already an unusual thing to do before it
was deprecated. Events are server initiated, and it seems strange for the server
to send an unsolicited failure to the client. It is better to use a union for
these rare use cases rather than having to support a language feature in all the
bindings.
