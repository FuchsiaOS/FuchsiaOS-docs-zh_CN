## fi-0029: Resource definition must have at least one property {:#fi-0029}

Resource definitions with no properties specified are prohibited:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0029.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Please specify at least one property:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0029.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

This is an error related to FIDL's internal implementation, and thus should only
ever be surfaced to developers working on FIDL's core libraries. End users
should never see this error.

The `resource_definition` declaration it refers to is FIDL's internal means of
defining resources like handles, and is likely to change in the future as part
of the [handle generalization](https://fxbug.dev/64629) effort.
