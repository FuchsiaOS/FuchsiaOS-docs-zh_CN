## fi-0057: Includes cycle {:#fi-0057}

There are a number of situations that could cause this problem to occur, but all
of them basically boil down to a FIDL declaration referring to itself in an
unresolvable way. The simplest form of this error is when a type or protocol
refers directly to itself in its own definition:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0057-c.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

More complex failure cases are possible when a type or protocol _transitively_
refers to itself via at least one level of indirection:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0057-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

<!-- TODO(fxbug.dev/109877): Improve example quality. -->
```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0057-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

This error can be resolved by adding an envelope (aka, optionality) somewhere in
the inclusion cycle, as this allows the cycle to be "broken" at encode/decode
time:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0057.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

<!-- TODO(fxbug.dev/35218): remove once this feature has landed -->
Caution: This feature is not yet implemented for all viable cases; for instance,
the following code will currently fail, despite including the requisite envelope
between the recursive reference and its definition. This is because recursive
types have not yet fully implemented: <https://fxbug.dev/35218>.

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0057-d.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Recursive types that are unbroken by envelopes are disallowed because they would
be impossible to encode. In the first example above, encoding `MySelf` would
require first encoding an instance of `MySelf`, which would in turn require
encoding an instance of `MySelf`, ad inifitum. A solution to this problem is to
add a "break" in this chain via optionality, where one may choose to either
encode another nested instance of `MySelf`, or otherwise encode a null envelope
with no further data.
