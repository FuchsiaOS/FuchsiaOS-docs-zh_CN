## fi-0033: Conflicting modifiers {:#fi-0033}

<!-- TODO(fxbug.dev/88366): Update this doc to describe open/closed/ajar when unknown interactions have landed. -->

Certain modifiers are mutually exclusive of one another and cannot both modify
the same declaration:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0033.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Only one of the `strict` or `flexible` modifiers may be used on a single
declaration at a time:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0033.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

At this time, only the `strict` and `flexible` modifiers are mutually exclusive
in this manner. The `resource` modifier has no reciprocal modifier, and thus has
no such restrictions applied to it.
