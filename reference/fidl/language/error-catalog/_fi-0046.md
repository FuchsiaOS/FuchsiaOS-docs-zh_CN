## fi-0046: Unknown library {:#fi-0046}

In most cases, this problem is due to the dependency being misspelled or not provided by the build system.
If the dependency in question is intentionally unused, the relevant using line must be removed:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0046.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Make sure all imports are added as dependencies to the library using the build system.

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0046.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```
