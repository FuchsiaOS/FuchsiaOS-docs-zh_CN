## fi-0159: Struct cannot be optional {:#fi-0159}

This error occurs when you mark a struct as optional while using the
`--experimental no_optional_structs` flag.

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0159.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

To fix the issue, `box` the struct instead of marking it `optional`:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0159.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Currently, `struct{...}:optional` is an alternative spelling of
`box<struct{...}>`. We are in the process of removing `struct{...}:optional`,
and making the ``--experimental no_optional_structs`` behavior the default.
After this is done, `struct{...}:optional` will no longer be allowed. You should
only use `box<struct{...}>` going forward and consider updating previous usages
of `struct{...}:optional` before this change becomes mandatory.

Caution: No optional structs is an experimental feature. It can only be used
when the experimental flag `no_optional_structs` is enabled.
