## fi-0179: Newtypes cannot be constrained {:#fi-0179}

Experimental: Newtypes are an unstable feature gated behind the
`--experimental allow_new_types` fidlc flag.

Newtypes from [RFC-0052: Type aliasing and new types][0179-rfc-0052] are not
allowed to be constrained. For example, a newtype of `string` cannot be
constrained with `:optional`:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0179.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

In this situation, we can make make the `name` field optional by putting it in a
table rather than a struct:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0179.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

This restriction simplifies the design of newtypes. It's not clear what the API
and ABI should look like for a constrained newtype in general (e.g., should the
constraints apply to the newtype itself, or flow through to the underlying
type?).
