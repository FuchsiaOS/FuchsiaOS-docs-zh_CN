## fi-0110: Resource containing types must be marked resource {:#fi-0110}

A type that includes a handle, either directly or through the transitive
inclusion of another handle-containing type, cannot be declared without that
type being specified as a `resource`:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0110.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

There are two possible solutions. The first is to annotate the offending
declaration with the resource modifier:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

<!-- TODO(fxbug.dev/109877): Improve example quality. -->
```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0110-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Alternatively, one could opt to remove the `resource`-including type completely,
thereby obviating the need for the modifier on the owning declaration:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0110-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

The reasoning and motivations behind the addition of the `resource` modifier and
the "infectious" nature of the usage pattern enforced by this error can be found
in [RFC-0057: Default no handles][rfc-0057].
