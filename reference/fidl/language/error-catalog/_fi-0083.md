## fi-0083: `fuchsia.io` must use explicit ordinals {:#fi-0083}

The FIDL compiler used to automatically rename `fuchsia.io` ordinals to
`fuchsia.io1`. This magic was intended to make it easier to migrate to
`fuchsia.io2` by letting the `io2` versions of the methods have the "normal"
ordinal. However, this system ended up being a bit too magical so it is now
required to manually provide the ordinal for `fuchsia.io`.

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0083.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

To fix this issue, manually provide a selector using `fuchsia.io1` as the
library name to allow the `fuchsia.io` names to be used for io2.
