## fi-0038: Name conflicts with import {:#fi-0038}

A declaration cannot have the same name as a library imported with `using`:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0038-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0038-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Instead, import the library under a different name with the `using` ... `as`
syntax:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0038-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Alternatively, rename the declaration to avoid the conflict:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0038-c.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

You can avoid this problem by using multiple components in library names. For
example, FIDL libraries in the Fuchsia SDK start with `fuchsia.`, so they have
at least two components and cannot conflict with declaration names.

This error exists to prevent ambiguities. For example, if `dependency` were an
enum with a member called `VALUE`, it would be ambiguous whether
`dependency.VALUE` referred to that enum member or to the const declared in the
imported library.
