## fi-0113: Mismatched transport in service {:#fi-0113}

A FIDL service is not allowed to contain protocols using different transports:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0113.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Instead, use separate services for each transport:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0113.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Note that services are an unfinished feature in FIDL. They were originally
designed in [RFC-0041: Support for unifying serviceas and
devices](/docs/contribute/governance/rfcs/0041_unifying_services_devices.md).
See [fxbug.dev/8035](https://bugs.fuchsia.dev/p/fuchsia/issues/detail?id=8035#c36)
for the status as of October 2022.
