## fi-0162: Wrong number of layout parameters {:#fi-0162}

Certain FIDL layouts, like `vector` and `array`, take parameters. This error
indicates that the highlighted type has an incorrect number of parameters
specified:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0162-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

It can also appear in cases where a non-parameterizable type has erroneously had
parameters attached to it:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0162-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

The fix is always to specify the correct number of parameters for the layout in
question:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0162.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

The only parameterized types in FIDL are `array<T, N>`, `box<T>`, and
`vector<T>`. The `client_end` and `server_end` types used to be parameterized in
an [older][rfc-0050] version of the FIDL syntax, but this is no longer the case,
though it is a frequent source of run-ins with this error. These two types now
take their protocol specification as a (required) constraint instead.

Parameters, which are always listed inside of angle brackets `<...>`, have some
similarities to constraints, which appear after the `:...` character at the end
of the type. For example, at first blush, it may appear odd that `array<T, N>`
specifies its size as a parameter, while `vector<T>:N` specifies its size as a
constraint. The difference is that parameters always affect the wire layout
shape of the type in question, while constraints merely alter the set of values
that are considered acceptable at encode/decode time for that type, with no
effect on wire layout.

See [RFC-0050: FIDL Syntax Revamp][rfc-0050] for a more thorough discussion of
the distinction between the two concepts.
