## fi-0100: Ordinals must be dense {:#fi-0100}

The ordinals for `table` and `union` layouts must start from 1 (see
[fi-0018](#fi-0018)), and must not be sparsely distributed:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0100.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

If this is a new declaration, and thus does not need to be versioned, the
ordinals may be freely adjusted to create a dense distribution:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0100-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Alternatively, if the type being modified already exists on running software,
and therefore needs to maintain [ABI compatibility][docs-fidl-compatibility], it
is important to leave the ordinals intact. Instead, mark removed fields as
`reserved` to evolve the type in a binary compatible way:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0100-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

FIDL requires ordinal density for `table` types to enforce wire efficiency.
Every "hole" in a table declaration, even when completely unused, costs 8 bytes
on the wire, so it is imperative to minimize these whenever possible. Allowing
sparse ordinals would create potential for massive holes, and thereby massive
message size bloat, in cases where users are not exceedingly careful.

See [fi-0093](#fi-0093) and [RFC-0132: FIDL table size limit][rfc-0132] for an
extended discussion of the limitations of the `table` wire format.
