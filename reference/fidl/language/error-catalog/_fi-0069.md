## fi-0069: Bits must use unsigned integral subtype {:#fi-0069}

Using signed numerics as the underlying type for a `bits` declaration is
prohibited:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0069.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Instead, use any one of the following: `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, or `uint64`:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0069.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Unlike `enum` declarations, which allow both signed and unsigned integers (see:
[fi-0070](#fi-0070)), `bits` declarations only permit the latter. This is
because each `bits` member necessarily represents a specific underlying bit in a
[bit array][wiki-bit-array] (this is the reason that [fi-0067](#fi-0067)
exists). This is most cleanly represented as a single unsigned integer. The
binary representation of unsigned integer maps directly to a single bit (2 to
the power of its index), whereas the negative numbers in signed integers almost
always select multiple bits due to the mechanics of the [two's complement
representation][wiki-twos-complement].

Note: if the value given for the underlying type of a `bits` is not an
identifier for a type, it will result in [fi-0013: Invalid wrapped
type](#fi-0013) instead.
