## fi-0012: Invalid type layout class {:#fi-0012}

Type declarations must specify a layout known to FIDL:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0012.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

<!-- TODO(fxbug.dev/111697): Add `overlay` to the list once it lands. -->

The valid layouts are `bits`, `enum`, `struct`, `table`, and `union`:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0012.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

A [layout][docs-fidl-lexicon-types] is a parameterizable description of a FIDL
type. It refers to a family of would-be types which can receive further
arguments to specify their shape. For example, a `struct` is a kind of layout
which becomes a concrete type when it has specific members defined, while an
`array` is a layout that becomes concrete when given  a type to be repeated
sequentially a specified number of times.

Layouts are all built into the FIDL language - there is no means by which users
can specify their own layouts, or create their own generic type templates.
