## fi-0098: Duplicate union member names {:#fi-0098}

The variant names used for members in a `union` declaration cannot be repeated:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0098.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Alter the variant names as needed to ensure that the declaration has unique names
for all of its members:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0098-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Alternatively, one of the members with the duplicated name can be removed:

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0098-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```
