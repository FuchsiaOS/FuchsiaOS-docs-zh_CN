## fi-0116: Flexible one-way method requires ajar or open protocol {:#fi-0116}

Closed protocols are not allowed to contain flexible one-way methods:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0116.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Instead, mark the one-way method `strict` instead of `flexible`:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0116-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Alternatively, mark the protocol `ajar` or `open` instead of `closed`:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0116-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

This error exists because the purpose of the `closed` modifier is to make sure a
method does not contain any flexible methods. When first creating a protocol,
you should carefully think about whether it should be closed, ajar, or open
based on the evolvability properties you need from it.

See [RFC-0138: Handling unknown
interactions](/docs/contribute/governance/rfcs/0138_handling_unknown_interactions.md)
for more information about protocol modifiers.

Caution: Unknown interactions is an experimental feature. It can only be used
when the experimental flag `unknown_interactions` is enabled. See
[fxbug.dev/88366](https://fxbug.dev/88366) for its current status.
