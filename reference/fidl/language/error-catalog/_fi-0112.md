## fi-0112: Service member is not a `client_end` {:#fi-0112}

Service members are only allowed to be client ends, not any other type:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0112.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

To fix the error, make sure the member has the form `client_end:P` for some protocol `P`:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0112.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

A service is a collection of protocol instances, not a general purpose data
structure, so it would not make sense for one to allow arbitrary types.
