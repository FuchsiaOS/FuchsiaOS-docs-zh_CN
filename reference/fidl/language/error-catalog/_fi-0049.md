## fi-0049: Optional union member {:#fi-0049}

Union members cannot be optional:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0049.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Remove the `optional` constraint:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0049.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

FIDL does not allow union members to be optional because this can result in many ways of expressing the same value.
For example, a union with three optional members would have 6 states (2 per member). Instead, this should be modeled with a
fourth member whose type is `struct {}`, or by making the overall union optional with `Foo:optional`.
