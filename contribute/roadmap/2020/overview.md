# Fuchsia 2020 roadmap overview

## FIDL

The [Fuchsia Interface Definition Language (FIDL)](/docs/glossary/README.md#fidl) is a
language for defining protocols that are typically used over
[channels](/docs/glossary/README.md#channel).

The FIDL team is actively exploring the following projects:

### Unifying FIDL C++ bindings {#unifying-fidl-cpp-bindings}

Currently, there are two FIDL binding implementations,
[high-level C++ bindings (HLCPP)](/docs/reference/fidl/bindings/hlcpp-bindings.md)
and
[low-level C++ bindings (LLCPP)](/docs/reference/fidl/bindings/cpp-bindings.md).
The FIDL team is exploring a solution that augments the LLCPP API surface to
allow the use of high-level domain objects wherever low-level domain objects are
currently used.

### Implementing FIDL versioning

This project helps Fuchsia evolve its APIs through a platform versioning
strategy, which involves annotating FIDL elements with version ranges and
providing tooling to use a FIDL API at a user-specified version.

### FIDL syntax revamp

The FIDL team is working to revamp the syntax for the FIDL language to help
developers understand when changes to a FIDL definition break downstream code.

## Migrating to fuchsia.hardware.network

The Connectivity team is actively exploring how to migrate existing Fuchsia
drivers and clients from
[`fuchsia.hardware.ethernet`](/sdk/banjo/fuchsia.hardware.ethernet) to
[fuchsia.hardware.network](/sdk/fidl/fuchsia.hardware.network.driver) in order
to improve network performance.

## Components v2

[Components v2](/docs/glossary/README.md#components-v2) is Fuchsia's component
architecture that replaces Components v1.

The following projects are currently underway:

### Continuing migration to Components v2

The goal of the [Component Framework](/docs/glossary/README.md#component-framework) is
to define Fuchsia's units of software execution as components, which are
singular abstractions throughout the Fuchsia system.

The Component Framework team is currently focusing on migrations in the
following areas:

-   The stack of Software Delivery components and associated tests, including
    the package cache and package resolver.
-   The Netstack2 components, including migration of Netemul and associated
    tests to Test Runner Framework.
-   A subset of components under `sysmgr` that are straightforward to migrate.

For more information, see
[Components v2 migration](/docs/contribute/open_projects/components/migration.md).

### Implementing drivers as components

The Driver Framework team is exploring how to use Components v2 to represent
drivers as components, so that drivers can interact with the rest of Fuchsia in
a uniform way.

## Miscellaneous

The following projects are under consideration by several different Fuchsia
teams:

### Implementing storage enhancements

Teams are evaluating potential improvements that could be made to
[MinFS](/docs/concepts/filesystems/minfs.md) and
[VFS](/docs/concepts/filesystems/life_of_an_open.md#vfs_layer), including generating
a system for benchmarking and implementing paging within the VFS layer.

### Implementing accessibility and input improvements

Multiple teams are collaborating to explore more inclusive handling of user
input events on workstations that are running Fuchsia.
