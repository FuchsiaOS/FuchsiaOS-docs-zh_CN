# Report an issue

Filing issues is a great way to contribute to the Fuchsia project.
You can file an issue using Monorail, Google’s issue tracking tool for open
source projects.

Note: You need a Google account to file an issue in Monorail.

## When to file an issue

Monorail issues are used to track and suggest the following
types of changes:

  + Minor changes or suggestions to Fuchsia's code and documentation.
  + [Reporting security issues](report-security-issue.md)
  + Proposing open source third-party code to be included in Fuchsia

For proposing code changes that would affect Fuchsia significantly, see
[Propose significant code changes](#significant-code-changes).

As an open source contributor, you can file a issue with the
following templates:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Template</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Purpose</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Fuchsia Default
   </td>
   <td>Alert the Fuchsia team that there is a bug related to using or building Fuchsia.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Fuchsia Security external bug report
   </td>
   <td>Report a security issue related to Fuchsia.

  </tr>
  <tr>

## Issue reporting guidelines

When you create an issue, include the following:

*   A description of the issue that you’re experiencing, including the
    expected behavior.
*   The steps necessary to reproduce the issue.
*   (Optional) Screenshots
*   (Optional) If a bug can be identified through a unit test,
    then create a simplified test and attach it to the issue.

## Issue resolution

After you have filed an issue, a team of triagers will route your issue to the
appropriate team. That team is responsible for prioritizing, assigning, and
responding to your issue.

## Propose significant code changes {:#significant-code-changes}

There are some instances where filing an issue would not be the best course of
action. Here are a few examples of alternative courses of action:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Scenario</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Process</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Proposing a change that would significantly affect the Fuchsia API.
   </td>
   <td>Create an API Design Document. For more information, see <a href="/docs/contribute/governance/api_council.md">Fuchsia API Council Charter</a>.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Proposing a change that would affect a large part of the Fuchsia codebase or the technical direction of the Fuchsia project.
   </td>
   <td>Propose a Request for Comments (RFC). For more information on RFCs, see <a href="/docs/contribute/governance/rfcs/create_rfc.md">Create an RFC</a>.
   </td>
  </tr>
