# Platform updatability best practices

<span class="compare-better">Recommended</span>: Use [FIDL] types and protocols
to define interfaces between any two things that may update separately. Leverage
the [FIDL rubric][fidl-rubric] where applicable.

- FIDL has [versioning annotations][rfc-0083].
- FIDL offers [API and ABI compatibility guarantees][fidl-compatibility].
- FIDL enables soft transitions by supporting
  [changing type definitions][rfc-0061],
  [adding and removing methods over time][rfc-0021], and
  [renaming types][rfc-0048].

<span class="compare-worse">Not recommended</span>: Avoid languages other than
FIDL to define interfaces where independent updates matter. These include:
plain text, JSON, and protocol buffers.

When reviewing alternatives, ask yourself what affordances they have for
updatability.

- Is there a schema for the data?
- Can the schema change over time, while providing backward/forward
  compatibility? How?
- What changes to the schema are API/ABI preserving/breaking? How would you know
  before committing a breaking change?
- Is the wire format stable?

<span class="compare-better">Recommended</span>: Be careful when designing
platform APIs and ABIs for use outside the platform. Design for updatability, find
ways to enforce that your clients use the intended interfaces, and donâ€™t offer
ways to circumvent the interface.

<span class="compare-worse">Not recommended</span>: Avoid exposing your clients
to your implementation details that are not contractual. Common mistakes include
exposing broadly-scoped capabilities or namespaces, and leaking implementation
details via [component identifiers][identifiers] (such as `fuchsia-pkg://` URLs)
and [diagnostics selectors][selectors].
