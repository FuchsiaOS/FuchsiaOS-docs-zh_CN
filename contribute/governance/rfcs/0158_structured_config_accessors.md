## Summary

Requirements, design philosophy, and high-level implementation details for
user-facing generated accessor libraries implementing [RFC-0127] for Structured
Configuration.

[RFC-0127]: /contribute/governance/rfcs/0127_structured_configuration.md

## Motivation

This RFC builds on the non-normative examples of user-facing APIs in the
[RFC for Structured Configuration][RFC-0127], outlining design principles and
constraints for the generated libraries developers will use to access their
configuration.

## Stakeholders

_Facilitator:_ hjfreyer@google.com

_Reviewers:_

* geb@google.com (Component Framework)
* jsankey@google.com (RFC-0127 author)
* yifeit@google.com (FIDL)

_Consulted:_ xbhatnag@google.com, hjfreyer@google.com, jamesr@google.com

_Socialization:_ This RFC is the product of discussions between members of the
Component Framework team and FIDL teams, answering questions that have arisen
while prototyping the initial phases of [RFC-0127].

## Design

[RFC-0127] sketches a user-facing interface for consuming configuration values
in code. It provides a statically-typed generated library specific to a
component's configuration, and it has a single entry point which is guaranteed
to return a valid configuration.

### Objectives

We have several objectives for accessors: they should convey infallibility, be
opaque with respect to overrides, be debuggable, and offer type interfaces which
are familiar to Fuchsia developers, reusing existing tooling where possible.

#### Infallible

A component author must be able to assume the values are always available, with
all fields always populated. Configuration fields' nullability should match the
input declaration (at time of writing nullable fields are not supported in
config schemas) and the accessor function should be infallible, i.e. not
returning an error or throwing an exception. Accessors should fail fast and
terminate component execution (e.g. `abort()`) if they receive a configuration
payload which they fail to parse.

#### Opaque

Per [RFC-0127], the Component Framework will eventually provide APIs for
overriding a component's configuration values at runtime. From an author's view,
the parsed type does not describe any overrides which may have occurred. The
generated libraries are not responsible for processing overrides.

#### Debuggable

Accessors should provide an option to output the component's configuration
as an Inspect hierarchy. This will allow config to be included in crash reports
with a minimal addition of code, without forcing the Component Framework to
store all config values in its memory, duplicating a component's own copies.

An alternative to generating Inspect output would be to expose config in
[Component Manager's Inspect](#cm-inspect).

#### Ergonomic

Generated libraries should have a single top-level type containing all of a
component's configuration fields. It should be returned by a single top-level
accessor function.

Users should only interact with the namespace or library name of a single
generated library, which they can control.

#### Familiar

Types generated for configuration schemas should feel familiar to users of FIDL
bindings.

### Syntax

Consider this `config` stanza using syntax from [RFC-0146]:

```json5
config: {
    check_interval_ns: { type: "int64" },
    data_path: {
        type: "string",
        max_size: 256,
    },
    test_only: { type: "bool" },
},
```

[RFC-0146]: ./0146_structured_config_schemas_in_cml.md

#### Build templates

In `fuchsia.git`, accessors must be defined in the same build file as the
component which defines the configuration keys. For example, with a Rust binary:

```gn
import("//build/components.gni")
import("//build/rust/rustc_binary.gni")

fuchsia_component("my_component") {
  manifest = "meta/my_component.cml"
  deps = [ ":my_bin" ]
}

fuchsia_structured_config_rust_lib("my_component_config") {
  library_name = "my_component"

  # NOTE: This target internally depends on a target which is generated by the
  # fuchsia_component() template, so the graph is not cyclic:
  #
  # :my_component -> :my_bin -> :config_lib -> :my_component_manifest_compile
  #
  # where :my_component_manifest_compile does not depend on :my_component
  component = ":my_component"

  # By default all fields are included, this Inspect won't have `data_path`
  inspect_skip_fields = ["data_path"]
}

rustc_binary("my_bin") {
  sources = [ "src/main.rs" ]
  deps = [ ":my_component_config" ]
}

fuchsia_structured_config_values("my_config_values") {
  component = ":my_component"
  values_source = "config/my_component.json5"
}

fuchsia_package("my_package") {
  deps = [
    ":my_component",
    ":my_config_values",
  ]
}
```

We will develop comparable build integrations for out-of-tree customers when
structured configuration is ready for OOT usage.

#### C++

```c++
#include "src/my_project/my_component/config.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  auto config = my_component::Config::TakeFromStartupHandle();

  auto context = sys::ComponentContext::CreateAndServeOutgoingDirectory();
  auto inspector_ = std::make_unique<sys::ComponentInspector>(context);
  config.RecordInspect(inspector_.GetRoot().CreateChild("config"));

  if config.test_only() {
    // ...
  }

  std::ifstream file(config.data_path());
  // ...

  while (true) {
    // ...
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(
      std::chrono::nanoseconds(config.check_interval_ns()));
  }
}
```

For a driver, the start arguments will be required to avoid process-global
dependencies:

```c++
#include "src/my_project/my_component/config.h"

zx_status<> Init(fdf::wire::DriverStartArgs& start_args, /*...*/) {
  auto config = my_component::Config::TakeFromStartArgs(start_args);
  // ...
}
```

Build templates in fuchsia.git will place headers in `target_gen_dir` and add
that to the library's `include_dirs` so that users can include the generated
header as an [implementation header] for their component.

When building accessors support in the SDK we will ensure that users can
configure the include directory layout to match any style guidance they have.

[implementation header]: /development/languages/c-cpp/naming.md#implementation_headers

#### Rust

```rust
#[fuchsia::component]
async fn main() {
    let inspector = fuchsia_inspect::component::inspector();
    let config_node = inspector.root().create_child("config");

    let config = my_component::Config::take_from_args();
    config.record_inspect(&config_node);

    if config.test_only {
        // ...
    }

    let contents = std::fs::read(&config.data_path).unwrap();
    let mut interval = Interval::new(Duration::from_nanos(config.check_interval_ns));
    let _checker = Task::local(async move {
        while let Some(()) = interval.next().await {
            // ... use `contents` ...
        }
    });

    // for completeness, set up an /out directory for our inspect and serve it
    let mut fs = ServiceFs::new_local();
    inspect_runtime::serve(inspector, &mut fs).unwrap();
    fs.take_and_serve_directory_handle().unwrap();
    while let Some(()) = fs.next().await {}
}
```

Note that this example uses async and a VFS to demonstrate serving Inspect, but
an executor and VFS implementation will not be required solely to access
structured configuration values.

## Implementation

### Versioning

Accessors will receive configuration values from the Component Framework with
a checksum of the configuration schema for which they were encoded (see the
[RFC for config in CML][cml-checksum] for background, a future RFC will specify
the delivery mechanism). The accessor must check that the received checksum
exactly matches the checksum with which the accessor was generated, aborting the
component if there is a mismatch. This will prevent misinterpreting the payload,
acting as a final guard to prevent mispackaging of component binaries and/or
manifests that were compiled from different schemas.

An implication of this design is that components will need to be recompiled
when their configuration schema changes.

[cml-checksum]: /contribute/governance/rfcs/0146_structured_config_schemas_in_cml.md#fidl-specification

A [rejected alternative](#runner-verification) would be to have the runner
cooperate with Component Manager to verify the checksum before starting the
component.

### Library internals

Per [RFC-0127], structured configuration payloads will be encoded as persistent
FIDL messages with a struct as the primary object (further details to be
recorded in a future RFC).

We will generate FIDL libraries for parsing the encoded messages, and also
generate small runtime-specific wrapper libraries which know how to

1. retrieve the encoded message from the language- or runner-specific runtime
1. check the encoded message's checksum against that from the component manifest
1. invoke the FIDL bindings' decode functionality
1. convert the decoded FIDL domain object into a generated type

We have considered and rejected alternatives to

* [generalize config-adjacent features within FIDL](#fidl-features)
* [add custom config attributes to FIDL](#fidl-attributes)
* [define fidlgen backends for producing config accessors](#fidlgen-backend)
* [expose FIDL domain objects directly from generated helpers](#layer-fidl)
* [generate config accessors without a FIDL dependency](#avoid-fidl)

#### Naming

The generated wrapper library will contain the intended user-facing APIs for
accessing configuration. The wrapper's namespace will by default be the same as
the target name for the GN rule which generates it and can be overridden with
the `library_name` argument.

The generated FIDL library will receive its name from build
templates, by default the GN target name with underscores removed, appended to
the platform name (`fuchsia.` for in-tree components). For example, in the
syntax snippets above, the GN template invocation creates a FIDL library name of
`fuchsia.mycomponent`.

The generated struct will be named `Config` and we may allow users to override
that if it is a commonly requested feature.

The [rules for configuration field identifiers][cml-idents] mean that all config
keys in CML are valid FIDL field identifiers, no mangling is required.

[cml-idents]: /contribute/governance/rfcs/0146_structured_config_schemas_in_cml.md#cml-syntax

#### Generated FIDL library

Each structured configuration schema is compiled to a FIDL struct which will
be converted to a type defined within the structured configuration wrapper.
Users will not be exposed to types generated by the FIDL toolchain.

For the syntax example above, this would be:

```
library fuchsia.mycomponent;

type Config = struct {
    check_interval_ns int64;
    data_path string:256;
    test_only bool;
};
```

#### Generated wrapper code

Each wrapper will contain a type that corresponds to the generated FIDL domain
object's type, but with an additional factory function to retrieve the config
from the component's runtime and a method to record the config to inspect.

Generated C++ libraries will provide an interface that feels familiar to users
of the natural types in the unified C++ FIDL bindings. For example, the above
syntax example would generate this in C++:

```cc
namespace my_component {
class Config {
public:
  static Config TakeFromStartupHandle() noexcept;
  void RecordInspect(inspect::Node* node);

  const uint64_t& check_interval_ns() const { return check_interval_ns_; }
  uint64_t& check_interval_ns() { return check_interval_ns_; }

  const std::string& data_path() const { return data_path_; }
  std::string& data_path() { return data_path_; }

  const bool& test_only() const { return test_only_; }
  bool& test_only() { return test_only_; }

private:
  // ...
};
};
```

In Rust, we will generate a type similar to the single flavor of bindings. The
syntax example above would generate this for Rust components:

```rust
pub struct Config {
    pub check_interval_ns: u64,
    pub data_path: String,
    pub test_only: bool,
}

impl Config {
  pub fn take_from_args() -> Self { ... }
  pub fn record_inspect(&self, node: &fuchsia_inspect::Node) { ... }
}
```

We will generate one "flavor" of accessor library for each language or runtime
environment which uses a different method to deliver encoded configuration
(details of runner implementation to be ratified in a future RFC). For example,
C++ drivers have a different accessor library than C++ components run
directly by the ELF runner, even though they use the same language.

### Language support

Initially we will support C++ and Rust. Over time we will cover all target-side
[supported languages].

[supported languages]: /contribute/governance/policy/programming_languages.md

### Dependencies

Each dependency for generated libraries represents a tax on OOT integrators and
should be avoided if possible.

### Out-of-tree support

It will eventually be necessary for out-of-tree customers to generate their own
configuration accessors, similar to how the FIDL toolchain is integrated with
petals' builds.

## Performance

Parsing structured configuration payloads may add some additional overhead to a
component's start time, with the most significant impact in cases where the
component previously compiled configuration values directly into its binary.
We do not expect user-visible impact either way because configuration parsing is
expected to be a one-time operation when a component first starts.

This potential impact will be partly mitigated by internally reusing parsers
generated by the FIDL toolchain, the performance of which is already benchmarked
continuously.

We will monitor the `TimeToStart` performance metric.

## Backwards Compatibility

Configuration accessor libraries are generated from a component's compiled
manifest and will embed the same [configuration schema checksum] as the
manifest. We will not support any version skew between a component's
configuration schema, its value file, and its accessor library. In the future,
evolution of configuration values may be supported by the overall Component
Framework but from the component's perspective it will always receive a complete
and consistent configuration.

[configuration schema checksum]: /contribute/governance/rfcs/0146_structured_config_schemas_in_cml.md#fidl-specification

## Security considerations

Components should trust that the configuration payloads they receive are
well-formed according to their declared schema, as the Component Framework
must only start the component if it can provide a compatible configuration. The
details of this resolution and encoding will be defined in a subsequent RFC.

We hope that providing infallible and non-nullable accessors will discourage the
use of default configuration values in code, making it easier to audit which
actual values are executed at runtime and reducing the surface area of possible
misconfigurations and subsequent attacks.

## Privacy considerations

Future extensions to structured configuration may require changes to support
working with PII but we do not anticipate any changes of which config accessors
would need to be aware.

It is not necessary to redact user data in generated Inspect helpers since
redaction is performed by Archivist when reading values. Users of structured
configuration will need to add their configuration fields to a product's
allowlist of selectors for them to appear in crash reports.

## Testing

To support developers writing tests, it should be possible to construct a
configuration object in code.

Use of accessor libraries will be covered by multi-language conformance tests
for structured configuration which ensure that configuration can be loaded,
resolved, encoded, delivered, and parsed by a component which reports the
results back to the conformance suite.

## Documentation

Accessor libraries will be documented with examples for each supported language
in the feature documentation and codelabs for structured configuration.

## Drawbacks, alternatives, and unknowns

### Alternative: Expose config in Component Manager's Inspect {#cm-inspect}

Instead of generating Inspect code within the accessor libraries, we could
add the resolved config values to Component Manager's Inspect output. There is
precedent for doing so with CPU stats, but tracking the resource usage of this
feature is difficult and we prefer a solution which "bills" the memory usage
to the component with the config values.

### Alternative: Global variables for access {#global-access}

We could consider accessor APIs that expose access to a single global instance
of the parsed configuration. For example, in Rust:

```
static CONFIG: Lazy<Config> = Lazy::new(|| /* ...retrieve from runner... */);
```

Using a single global instance of configuration values is attractive from the
perspective of resource economy, as it would use language features to ensure
only a single copy of a component's configuration was instantiated into memory
at a time. It also conceptually mirrors how developers often think of their
configuration.

However many languages discourage use of globals/statics except when necessary,
and choosing this style of API would force developers into their use even when
not strictly necessary. Developers of individual components will still have the
option of wrapping the generated accessor result in a global variable.

Further, some environments (e.g. the current driver framework) discourage or
disallow the use of globals with implicit initialization. The style of
generated configuration access should be as familiar as possible to developers
across different environments, and using function calls means those different
environments will only differ in requiring additional parameters.

### Alternative: runner-based verification {#runner-verification}

For ELF-based components, it would be possible to include the configuration
checksum in a custom header which could be verified by the runner with help
from the loader service. This would allow the Component Framework to verify that
the compiled accessor matched the encoded values before executing a component's
code, which would allow reporting an error directly to the logs without relying
on the component to have correctly configured its outputs before attempting to
read the configuration. That said, we anticipate a checksum mismatch to be a
rare occurrence when components are packaged using tools from the SDK and it
would take much more effort to design and implement a faster-failing checksum
verification step in the loader and runner.

A design for verifying configuration checksums before creating processes would
need to handle cases where a single binary is used to serve multiple components
with different configuration interfaces.

We do not anticipate that failures to verify the checksum will be common, and so
the value of shifting errors from them earlier will be limited. We also have the
additional option of including accessor library metadata in binaries in a way
that the product assembly tooling can verify, which would give us an even
earlier point in the component development lifecycle to surface these errors.
The high complexity to implement pre-process-creation verification, the low
expected value of the improved experience, and the opportunity to shift these
errors earlier with tools outside the platform suggest we should not pursue this
feature until we get new information that changes how we view these tradeoffs.

### Alternative: Refine checksum & Inspect support into FIDL features {#fidl-features}

We could decide to generalize the type hashing and debugging features we need
for structured configuration and make them available to all users of FIDL.

This approach is promising in the longer term and the CF and FIDL teams will be
taking on an effort to align their technologies more closely as a result of
discussions around this RFC and other topics. In particular, we will discuss:

* designing private or "component-local" namespacing for generated FIDL code,
  which would allow us to generate code with additional dependencies without
  impacting the general IPC use cases, also addressing questions around
  naming and platform versioning
* options within FIDL for "lockstep versioning" that would provide tools to
  prevent skew between component manifests and implementing binaries
* generating additional Inspect debugging code for FIDL types

The work needed on the FIDL side to support these concepts will take
some time and we are choosing not to block structured config accessors
on it. We anticipate future RFCs to describe these and other component-aware
features for FIDL, and to migrate structured config users to new accessor APIs
if necessary.

### Alternative: Support in FIDL bindings & reusable runtime libraries {#fidl-attributes}

We could modify FIDL backends to emit additional code to support structured
configuration use cases. This could be done either with a flag passed to the
backend (e.g. `--enable-config-codegen`) or via custom attributes that are
passed through to the backend (e.g. `@structured_config_checksum()` and
`@structured_config_inspect()`).

This would allow us to emit code for checksum verification and Inspect debugging
and to then invoke that functionality from reusable libraries that are aware of
each runtime's method for passing encoded configuration to a component.

This option has the advantage of reducing the number of "flavors" of codegen we
do, because no code generator needs to be aware of each runtime's methods for
delivering config -- that knowledge can always live in reusable libraries. It
also has the advantage of reducing the effort to integrate structured config
with an OOT build system, as existing ones have already integrated the FIDL
toolchain.

However, this option has a significant drawback. The FIDL toolchain does not
currently have a way to mark features in bindings as unstable or experimental.
All code emitted by the binding has the same stability needs which means that
adding structured configuration attributes to an SDK-available C++ backend would
be immediately available for all SDK customers. This is in conflict with our
goal to roll out structured config incrementally, preserving the ability to
modify the APIs as much as possible while we continue to learn from our users.

Further, it is unclear whether it makes sense for the FIDL toolchain to
generate layers of bindings which take dependencies on higher-level Fuchsia
concepts like Inspect when the currently-generated bindings are themselves used
to implement those higher-level concepts.

### Alternative: fidlgen backends for configuration {#fidlgen-backend}

We could define separate backends for generating structured config support code.
This would allow us to achieve different stability properties than the current
fidlgen backends and to include additional dependencies in the generated
accessors.

However, to avoid exposing users to multiple generated namespaces we would need
to emit both config support code and FIDL domain objects within a single
namespace. This generated library could not be linked into the same binary as
a basic/non-config FIDL binding for the same library. In practice we would not
expect users to try to generate both "config-aware" and "basic" FIDL bindings
for a given library, but it would create new constraints on FIDL codegen to
either guard against that use case or design around it. We believe that this
solution would only be temporary until we reconcile CF and FIDL technologies
more broadly. We prefer to take on tech debt that grants greater design and
implementation freedom without creating potential maintenance hazards for the
FIDL team.

### Alternative: Expose FIDL libraries with additional layers {#layer-fidl}

We could generate a "base" FIDL binding that has the same contents as all
bindings today, and then generate an additional "layer" of config support code
which knows how to retrieve that FIDL type from a component's runtime. This
would achieve our implementation goals of clean separations between FIDL IPC
and other concerns, but would expose users to two generated namespaces without
giving them any additional benefit.

### Alternative: Generating libraries with no FIDL dependency {#avoid-fidl}

We could consider having no FIDL dependency whatsoever and generating our own
parsers. This approach would be more attractive if we found we were not able
to insulate users from the generated FIDL dependency of an accessor library.

## Prior art and references

The work here is similar in many ways to FIDL, and readers of this RFC would
benefit from an understanding of accessing Fuchsia's binary formats.

Fuchsia has a number of examples of hand-written accessors for
configuration, for example [`fshost`'s configuration class][fshost-config] which
used to parse a custom line-delimited format before [switching][fshost-switch]
to an early prototype of structured configuration.

There are many language-specific libraries which provide "typed parsers" for
dynamic "configuration interfaces" like `argv` or JSON configuration files.
In `fuchsia.git`, [`argh`](https://docs.rs/argh) is a popular Rust library
for parsing `argv`, and `serde`/`serde_json` are frequently used in a similar
fashion for parsing configuration files out of bootfs and packages.
