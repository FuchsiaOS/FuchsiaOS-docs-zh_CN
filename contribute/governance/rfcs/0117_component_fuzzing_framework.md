## Summary

[Guided fuzzing][209] is an effective way of reducing bugs and increasing
confidence in a platform, but there currently is no fuzzing framework available
that can fuzz across multiple process boundaries as found in Fuchsia
[component topologies][204]. This document proposes a design for such a
framework that shares [coverage][301] and [test inputs][320] across processes
and within [test realms][203], allowing components to be fuzzed in their most
typical configurations.

## Motivation

> Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show
> their absence!

> --<cite>[Edsger W. Dijkstra][325]</cite>

Guided fuzzing is a process of testing software in a feedback loop with
generated data:

1. A fuzzer generates some **test input** data and uses it to test the
   **target** software.
1. If the test results in a failure, the fuzzer records the input and exits.
1. Target software produces **feedback** that is collected by the fuzzer.
1. The fuzzer uses the feedback to generate additional test inputs, and repeats.

Guided fuzzing is extremely useful for finding software errors that are
unrelated to project requirements (and therefore often untested). By automating
test coverage, it can also improve developers' confidence of critical portions
of the system that have **security**, **correctness**, and/or **stability**
considerations.

Guided fuzzing frameworks can be described using the following taxonomy:
<br>![Fuzzing taxonomy][407]<br>

* **Engine**: The target-agnostic feedback loop.
  * **Corpus management**: Maintains a collection of fuzzing inputs (a
    **corpus**). Records new inputs and modifies existing ones (e.g. merging).
      * The **seed corpus** is a set of handcrafted initial inputs.
      * The **live corpus** is a continually updated set of generated inputs.
  * **Mutators**: A set of **mutation strategies** and a source of deterministic
    pseudo-randomness used to create new inputs from the corpus.
  * **Feedback analysis**: Dispositions an input based on its feedback.
  * **Management interface**: Interacts with the user to coordinate workflows:
      * Exercising the target with a specific input, i.e. performing a single
        **fuzzer run**.
      * Fuzzing a target, i.e. performing a (possibly indefinite) sequence of
        fuzzer runs.
      * Analyzing or manipulating a given corpus.
      * Responding to a detected error and/or processing the artifact that
        caused it.
* **Target**: The specific target realm being fuzzed.
  * **Input processing**: Maps the fuzzer input for a single run to the code
    under test, e.g. via a specific function, an I/O pipe, etc.
  * **Feedback collection**: Observes the behavior caused by an input. May
    collect hardware or software traces, code-coverage data, timings, etc.
  * **Error detection**: Determines when an input has caused an error. Collects
    and records **test artifacts**, e.g. the input, logs, backtraces, etc.

Several of these aspects may require specific support from the OS and/or its
toolchain, such as feedback collection and error detection. Currently on
Fuchsia, the most fully supported fuzzing framework is [libFuzzer][319], which
is delivered via the prebuilt [clang][215] toolchain as a
[compiler runtime][302]. Support has been added both to the
[sanitizer_common][312] runtime used to collect code coverage feedback, and to
libFuzzer itself to detect [exceptions][208]. Along with a set of
[GN templates][218] and [host tools][220], these allow developers to quickly
develop fuzzers for libraries on Fuchsia.

Unlike Linux, however, on Fuchsia the basic executable units of software are
components, not libraries. Using existing guided fuzzing frameworks to fuzz
components is cumbersome, as the granularity of their feedback is either too
narrow (e.g. libFuzzer in a [single process][114]), or too broad (e.g.
[TriforceAFL][115] on an instance of qemu).

An ideal framework for fuzzing components in Fuchsia has the following features:

* Integration with existing continuous fuzzing infrastructures, such as
  [ClusterFuzz][315].
* A modular approach that can leverage platform-agnostic portions of other
  fuzzing frameworks, e.g. mutation strategies.
* A high performance, cross-process code coverage mechanism.
* Integration with existing Fuchsia workflows, such as [`ffx`][223].
* A hermetic environment that can isolate the components under test and/or
  provide mock components for their dependencies.
* Unmodified source for target components.
* A robust and flexible approach to analyzing execution and detecting errors.
* A developer story similar to other styles of testing within Fuchsia.

## Design

This design tries to:

* Be idiomatic to Fuchsia.
* Reuse existing implementations.

At a high-level the design leverages the test runner framework and adds:

* A `fuzzer_engine` to drive fuzzing.
* An `ffx` plugin and fuzz manager to interact with and manage fuzzers.
* A `fuzz_test_runner` to connect the `fuzzer_engine` to the fuzz manager.

<br>![Component fuzzing framework design][402]<br>

This section of the document is organized roughly according to control flow;
i.e. it starts with a human or bot desiring to perform a fuzzing task and works
towards the target realm being fuzzed. The reader should be aware that some
sections refer to concepts described in detail in subsequent sections.

### `ffx fuzz` host tool

Users (both humans and bots) interact with the framework via an
[`ffx` plugin][222]. This plugin will be able to communicate with a
[`fuzz_manager`][103] service via:

* The [`fuchsia.fuzzer.Manager`][108] protocol.
* The [data transfer protocol][109].

The subcommands of `ffx fuzz` mirror those of `fx fuzz`, e.g.:

* `analyze`: Report coverage info for a given corpus and/or dictionary.
* `check`: Check on the status of one or more fuzzers.
* `coverage`: Generate a coverage report for a test.
* `list`: List available fuzzers in the current build.
* `repro`: Reproduce fuzzer findings by replaying test units.
* `start`: Start a specific fuzzer.
* `stop`: Stop a specific fuzzer.
* `update`: Update the BUILD.gn file for a fuzzer corpus.

### Fuzz manager

The [test runner framework][210] provides two important features:

* It makes it easy to create complex yet hermetic test realms and drive them
  with customizable [test runners][212].
* It provides the means to collect important diagnostics such as logs and
  backtraces.

Moreover, a single fuzzing run can be naturally expressed in the terminology of
the component testing framework: the code is exercised with a given test input,
and can be thought of as having passed or failed depending on whether an error
occurred.

However, fuzz testing does differ from other forms of testing, and this
difference is amplified when comparing *continuous fuzzing* to *continuous
testing*:

* The test inputs are not known a priori.
  * Test inputs are generated as a result of fuzzing.
  * A continuous fuzzing infrastructure such as [ClusterFuzz][315] will have
    many instances of a fuzzer and will "cross-pollinate" their test inputs
    *while fuzzing is ongoing*.
* Fuzz test execution is open-ended. Fuzz tests never really "pass", they only
  fail or are stopped early.
  * A consequence is the need to provide on-demand status that includes details
    not typically provided by other tests, such as execution speed, total
    feedback collected, memory consumed, etc.
  * This status needs to be provided on an ongoing basis to the human or fuzzing
    infrastructure bot that is monitoring the fuzzer's execution.
* Fuzz test results are richer than simply pass/fail.
  * On failure, outputs need to include the triggering input as well as any
    associated logs and backtraces.
  * On early termination, outputs may include accumulated feedback and
    recommended parameters (e.g. dictionaries) for future fuzzing.
* A fuzzed realm can be used for several different workflows that the *fuzzing
  infrastructure* chooses to perform in succession, e.g. "Fuzz for a while. If
  an error is found, cleanse it, otherwise, merge and compact the corpus".
  Representing each step as a test suite leads to significant work extracting
  state from one step only to restore it on the next.

Some of these can be addressed by extending the test runner framework, e.g. it
could provide structured outputs. However, using this approach for all the
fuzzing needs would add significant capabilities to other tests that do not need
them. For this reason, the design adds a new `fuzz_manager` that:

* Provides the management interface to users via `ffx`.
* Interacts with the `test_manager` to launch fuzzers within a fuzzed realm in
  the [test runner framework][104].
* Provides a [`fuchsia.fuzzer.manager.Harness`][108] for those fuzzers to
  connect back and service user requests.
* Provides a [data transfer protocol][109] to facilitate injecting data into or
  extracting data from fuzzers.

The test runner framework is then modified as follows:

1. A new `fuzz_test_runner` is added. This runner builds on the existing
  `elf_test_runner` to start the `fuzzer_engine` and pass it the fuzzer URL.
1. The `test_manager` is modified to route the
  [`fuchsia.fuzzer.manager.Harness`][108] capability to the `fuzz_test_runner`.
  This capability is *not* routed to tests, and the hermeticity of non-fuzzers
  is unaffected.
1. The `fuzz_test_runner` creates a channel pair for the
  [`fuchsia.fuzzer.Controller`][108] protocol. It installs one end as a startup
  handle in the `fuzzer_engine` and uses [`fuchsia.fuzzer.manager.Harness`][108]
  to pass the other to the the `fuzz_manager`.

### Fuzzer engine

The `fuzzer_engine` is a component of fuzzed realm. In terms of the
[fuzzer taxonomy][101], it:

* Implements the `fuchsia.fuzzer.Controller` protocol to provide the
  *management interface*.
* Creates and uses a storage capability to *manage each corpus*.
* *Mutates* inputs from the corpus to create new test inputs. (e.g. links
  against [libMutagen][324]).
* `Uses` an `Adapter` capability to send new *inputs to be processed*.
* `Exposes` a `fuchsia.fuzzer.ProcessProxy` capability that instrumented remote
  processes in the fuzzed realm can use to provide *collected feedback* and
  *report errors*.
* *Analyzes the feedback*.

If fuzzing is considered as a series of tests with different input, then one
approach is to having the fuzzer engine instantiate a fresh test realm for each
input, i.e. have a test *runner* perform each fuzzing *run* in succession. The
major problem with such an approach is the performance of the feedback analysis
and mutation loop. Fuzzer quality is directly tied to throughput, and the main
loop must be extremely fast: the overhead of "mutate, process input, collect
feedback, and analyze feedback" should be on the order of microseconds.

For this reason, the fuzzer engine is included in the test realm itself in a
manner similar to the test driver used for [testing complex topologies][214].
[Shared VMOs][207] coordinated by [eventpairs][205] are used to transfer test
inputs to the [fuzz target adapter][106] and feedback from
[instrumented remote processes][107] with the lowest possible latency.

The fuzzer engine is started by a `fuzz_test_runner`. This runner is extremely
similar to the existing [`elf_test_runner`][211], with one significant addition:
It creates a channel pair for the `fuchsia.fuzzer.Controller` protocol. It
installs one end of this pair as a startup handle in the `fuzzer_engine`. It
passes the other to the `fuzz_manager` using the `fuchsia.fuzz.manager.Harness`
capability routed to it by the `test_manager`. This allows `test_manager` to
provide the `Harness` capability only to the `fuzz_test_runner` and the fuzzers
it starts, rather than to all tests.

### Target adapter

The fuzz target adapter performs the *input processing* role in the
[fuzzer taxonomy][101]. Using the shared VMO and eventpair described above, it
takes the test inputs generated by the fuzzer engine and maps them to specific
interactions with the [instrumented remote processes][107] of the target realm
being fuzzed.

These specific interactions are **provided by the fuzzer author** and are
typically the contribution referred to as "writing a fuzzer".

A fuzzer author can provide their own custom implementation of a fuzz target
adapter, or use one of the provided scaffolds.

Examples of possible adapter scaffolds include:

* `llvm_fuzzer_adapter`: Expects authors to implement LLVM's
  [fuzz target function][221].
  * For C/C++, authors implement:

    ```cpp
    extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size);
    ```

  * For Rust, authors implement a method with `#[fuzz]` `proc_macro` attribute.
  * For Go, authors implement:

    ```golang
    func Fuzz(s []byte);
    ```

* `realm_builder_adapter`: In addition to the LLVM fuzz target function,
  authors implement a method that modifies a provided `RealmBuilder`. The
  adapter provides a default builder to this function and uses the result to
  build the realm of components to be fuzzed. Authors can modify it by adding
  additional routes, capabilities, mocks, etc.:

  ```rust
  pub trait FuzzedRealmBuilder {
    fn extend(builder : &mut RealmBuilder);
  }
  ```

* `libfuzzer_adapter`: Similar expectations to `llvm_fuzzer_adapter`, but its
  component manifest omits the fuzzer engine, exposes the [`Controller`][108]
  capability itself, and links directly against [libFuzzer][319]. This
  distinctly different component topology allows conventional library fuzzing
  with libFuzzer in this framework.
* `honggfuzz-persistent-adapter`: Expects fuzzer authors to implement:

  ```
  extern HF_ITER(uint8_t** buf, size_t* len);
  ```

  [`honggfuzz`][311] itself is not currently supported, but fuzz target
  functions written for it can still integrate with this framework.

Note that the target adapter can and should also link against the remote library
and act as an instrumented remote process along with those in the instrumented
target.

### Instrumented remote processes

In order to collect feedback and detect errors, all processes within the target
realm being fuzzed need to be built with additional instrumentation (e.g.
[SanitizerCoverage][301]). For fuzzers built in-tree, this can be achieved via a
[toolchain variant][201] that propagates `flags` and `deps` to a GN target's
dependencies. Required flags, e.g. `-fsanitize-coverage=inline-8bit-counters`,
will be documented to also allow out-of-tree compilation.

Additionally, the processes also need a `fuchsia.fuzzer.ProcessProxy` client
implementation. The same toolchain variant described above can automatically add
a dependency to link processes for in-tree fuzzers against a remote library.

The remote library provides, in terms of the [fuzzing taxonomy][101]:

* *Feedback collection* via callbacks, e.g.
  `__sanitizer_cov_inline_8bit_counters_init`.
* Early startup connection to the `fuzzer_engine`'s `ProcessProxy`.
* Background threads that can *detect errors*, e.g. by monitoring exceptions,
  memory usage, etc.

Out-of-tree fuzzers can provide their own client implementations. Adding the
`fuchsia.fuzzer.ProcessProxy` FIDL interface and remote library implementation
to the SDK will make writing out-of-tree fuzzers easier.

Finally, the needed compile-time modifications are only transformations on LLVM
IR. All other modifications are link-time only. This enables service providers
to provide "fuzzing as a service" to SDK consumers who are willing to provide
[LLVM bytecode][318] for their components, without requiring source code.

### Component Topology

Putting all of the above together, fuzzer component topology includes:

* `core`: The system root component.
* `fuzz_manager`: Bridge in the root realm between the fuzzer and the host tool.
* `test_manager`: As in the [test runner framework][213].
* `target_fuzzer`: Fuzzed realm entry point.
* `fuzzer_engine`: Target-agnostic fuzzing driver.
* `target_adapter`: Target-specific component with user-provided input
  processing code.
* `instrumented_target`: Component being fuzzed.

The `adapter` and `target` components may have additional children, such as
mocks and the target realm being fuzzed.

The interactions of the pieces described above can be illustrated as follows:
<br>![Fuzzing framework topology][408]<br>

### FIDL interfaces

The framework adds two FIDL libraries: one for interacting with the
`fuzz_manager`, and another for interacting with the fuzzers themselves.

#### `fuchsia.fuzzer.manager`

Types defined by `fuchsia.fuzzer.manager` include:

* `LaunchError`: An extensible `enum` listing errors related to finding and
  launching a fuzzer.

Protocols defined by `fuchsia.fuzzer.manager` include:

* `fuchsia.fuzzer.manager.Coordinator`: Served by `fuzz_manager` to the user via
  `ffx`. Includes a method to start a fuzzer and connect a
  `fuchsia.fuzzer.Controller`, and a method to stop fuzzers.
* `fuchsia.fuzzer.manager.Harness`: Served by `fuzz_manager` to the
  `fuzz_test_runner`, via static routing through `core` and `test_manager`. The
  runner uses this protocol to pass one end of a channel to the manager that can
  be used for the `fuchsia.fuzzer.Controller` protocol.

#### `fuchsia.fuzzer`

Types defined by `fuchsia.fuzzer` include:

* `Options`: An extensible `table` with parameters to configure execution, error
  detection, etc.
* `Feedback`: A flexible `union` representing target feedback, e.g. code
  coverage, traces, timings, etc.
* `Status`: An extensible `table` with various fuzzing metrics, e.g. total
  coverage, speed, etc.,
* `FuzzerError`: An extensible `enum` listing error categories, e.g. those
  recognized by [ClusterFuzz][315].

Protocols defined by `fuchsia.fuzzer` include:

* `fuchsia.fuzzer.Controller`: Provided by the `fuzzer_engine`, and passed to
  the `fuzz_manager` via the `fuzz_test_runner`. Proxied by the `fuzz_manager`
  to the user. Includes methods to transfer inputs to or artifacts from the
  fuzzer, and perform workflows on a fuzzer like input minimization, corpus
  merging, and normal fuzzing.
* `fuchsia.fuzzer.CorpusReader`: Requested from `fuchsia.fuzzer.Controller`.
  Used to get inputs from a specific seed or live corpus.
* `fuchsia.fuzzer.CorpusWriter`: Requested from `fuchsia.fuzzer.Controller`.
  Used to add inputs to a specific seed or live corpus.
* `fuchsia.fuzzer.Adapter`: Provided to the `fuzzer_engine` by the
  developer-provided `target_adapter`. Includes a method to register the
  coordinating eventpair and the shared VMO used to send test inputs.
* `fuchsia.fuzzer.ProcessProxy`: Provided by the `fuzzer_engine` to each
  instrumented process in the fuzzed realm. Includes methods to register the
  coordinating eventpair and to register shared VMOs used to provide feedback.

### Build utilities

The framework provides a `fuchsia_fuzzer_package` GN template to developers.
This allows them to:

* Automatically include the fuzzer_engine.
* Produce metadata that can be used by tooling, e.g. the location of a seed
  corpus.
* Build integration tests instead of fuzzers when a non-fuzzing toolchain
  variant is selected, as described in the [Testing][113] section.
* Reuse the build rules for the components under test from relevant integration
  tests.

The framework also includes a [component manifest shard][202] that includes
common elements needed for fuzzers, e.g. the `fuzzer_engine` and its
capabilities, the `fuzz_test_runner`, etc. A component manifest for a fuzzer
consists of:

* The default fuzzer shard.
* A URL to the target-adapter component.
* A URL to manifest of the component(s) being fuzzed. This should typically be
  reusable from a relevant integration test.

Together, these build utilities designed to make the fuzzer development
experience similar to the [integration test development experience][214].
Compare:
<br>![Test and fuzzer development process][403]<br>

## Implementation

The implementation plan is straightforward: develop and unit test individual
classes in a series of changes, then assemble integration tests derived from
libFuzzer as discussed in the [Testing][113] section.

### Language

The `fuzzer_engine` and `remote_library` are implemented in C++ to facilitate
their idiosyncrasies:

* The `fuzzer_engine` and `remote_library` both must integrate with other C
  ABIs, e.g. [libMutagen][324], [SanitizerCoverage][301], etc.
* Most `remote_library` functionality happens "before `main` and after `exit`",
  i.e. when [LLVM modules][321] are constructed and/or loaded, when `atexit`
  handlers are run, or when a fatal exception has been raised. As a result, the
  framework needs explicit control over subtle details of ELF executables'
  lifecycles.

Other pieces, e.g. the `realm_builder_adapter`, are written in Rust.

### Data transfer protocol

There are several situations in which users need to be able to provide or
retrieve arbitrary amounts of data, including:

* Providing specific test inputs to execute, cleanse, or minimize.
* Synchronizing a fuzzer corpus with one on a developer's host, or across many
  [ClusterFuzz][315] instances.
* Extracting the test input that triggered an error.

To minimize maintenance burden, it is desirable to transfer this data using
[overnet][304]. However, any single transfer may [exceed the size][206] of a
single FIDL message over a Zircon channel. Instead, the [`Controller`][108]
protocol includes several methods that provide `zx_socket` objects which the
fuzzer engine uses to stream data to or from VMOs and/or locally stored files.

The data is streamed using a minimal protocol to read or write a named sequence
of bytes. The protocol is *not* FIDL, as the data being sent may exceed the
maximum length of a FIDL message. Still the named bytes sequences are
conceptually equivalent to the following FIDL struct:

```fidl
struct NamedByteSequence {
  uint32 name_length;
  uint32 size;
  bytes:name_length name;
  bytes:size data;
};
```

### Stack unwinding

Currently, libFuzzer uses an unwinder from LLVM that assumes it is called from a
POSIX signal handler executing on the thread that triggered the signal. For
Fuchsia, this has necessitated a complex approach to handling exceptions that
includes modifying the stack of a crashed thread and injecting a backtrace-
preserving assembly trampoline to "resurrect" the thread in the unwinder.

None of this is needed if errors are not being handled by libFuzzer. Instead,
different types errors are handled whichever way is most convenient and
effective, e.g.:

* Exceptions are handled by the [fuzzer engine][104], which receives an
  exception channel from the fuzz test runner that it created from its handle to
  the test job.
* Timeouts are also managed by the fuzzer engine.
* Sanitizer callbacks and OOMs are handled by the remote library, which notifies
  the fuzzer engine.

## Performance

Fuzzing is not performed on production systems, and therefore has no impact on
the performance of any shipping code. While the inclusion of fuzzing toolchain
variants does have a minor impact on the performance of building Fuchsia, this
framework will reuse the existing variants and should add no new impacts.

Similarly, the generation of unit tests from fuzzer on uninstrumented builds
mirrors the current approach and is not expected to add any significant
per-fuzzer testing costs over the current approach.

For the fuzzers themselves, the most critical metric for determining fuzzer
quality is coverage per unit time, which can be derived by measuring two
additional metrics:

1. The total coverage of a fuzzer running over a fixed amount of time.
1. The total number of runs performed in a fixed amount of time.

[ClusterFuzz][315] already monitors and publishes these metrics for each fuzzer
on its dashboard.

## Ergonomics

Ergonomics is an important facet of this design, as its impact depends on
adoption by developers.

This framework attempts to make fuzzing as easy as possible in several ways. It
allows developers to:

* Write fuzzers in both familiar and flexible ways, as noted in the
  [target adapter][106] section.
* Build fuzzers using the existing family of [GN fuzzing templates][218].
* Run fuzzers using familiar workflows. The usage of`ffx fuzz` is intentionally
  similar to `fx fuzz`.
* Get actionable results. By integrating with [ClusterFuzz][315] bugs are filed
  automatically with symbolized backtraces and reproduction instructions.

## Backwards Compatibility

Existing libFuzzer-based fuzzers implement the [fuzz target function][320]. By
providing a libFuzzer-specific [fuzz target adapter][106], these fuzzers will be
able to work in this framework without any source modification.

## Security considerations

This framework will not be used on a shipping product configuration. For devices
built in a fuzzing configuration, communication to and from the device will use
the existing authentication and secure communication features provided by
[`overnet`][109] and [`ffx`][102].

The fuzzer outputs may have security considerations, e.g. a test input may cause
an exploitable memory corruption. These concerns MUST be handled by the fuzzer
operator (human or fuzzing infrastructure) in the same manner as any other
exploitable bug report (e.g. correct labelling, prevention of unauthorized
disclosure, etc.).

## Privacy considerations

When considering privacy implications, no assumptions are made about how the
fuzzer operator handles fuzzer outputs. These outputs consist of symbolized
logs, error-causing inputs, generated dictionaries, and generated corpora.
The logs are assumed to already be free of user data, as that is a separate
and closely monitored privacy concern. The remaining outputs are all directly
derived from test inputs. Thus, keeping fuzzer _inputs_ free of user data is
necessary and sufficient to keep fuzzer _outputs_ free of user data.

There are three ways inputs are added to a fuzzer's corpora:

* As seed inputs. The seed corpus should be checked in to the source repository.
  The usual restrictions against including user data in the source repository
  apply.
* As manual addtions to the live corpus.
  * This will most typically be done by the fuzzing infrastructure, e.g.
    [ClusterFuzz][315], as it "cross-pollinates" fuzzers with inputs produced by
    other instances. In this case, the other instances will not contain user
    data, and the added inputs will not either.
  * It is also possible for a human operator to add inputs via [`ffx`][102].
    The tool will display warnings about user data when adding manual inputs in
    this manner.
* As generated additions to the live corpus. These inputs are mutated from
  existing inputs. Since those inputs are user-data free, the generated ones are
  as well. It is possible some inputs may match some user-data by pure chance,
  e.g. the fuzzer manages to generate a valid username. However, in this case
  there is no clear association to user data.

No other data is included in the corpus, even if the fuzzer is non-hermetic (and
non-deterministic!) and uses data from sources exposed by the test realm. The
framework will not consider that data as part of the test input and will not
save it.

The worst-case scenario is a fuzzer that is designed to be intentionally
non-hermetic and uses exposed capabilities to send data _out_ of the test realm
to some other service that validates PII, e.g. return whether a username is
valid. This would require a noticeable amount of effort to circumvent the
fuzzing and test frameworks attempts to encourage hermeticity. And, since the
external service is uninstrumented, this is no better than random guessing.

Additionally, in practice the fuzzers will be completely hermetic. They will not
be run on product configurations with user data, but only locally when
developing fuzzers and on ClusterFuzz.

## Testing

The fuzzer engine, and target adapter libraries, and remote library are unit
tested using the usual approaches (e.g. [GoogleTest][317], `#[cfg(test)]`,
etc.). Additionally, integration tests use the default ELF test runner to run a
set of fuzzing workflows with purpose-built example targets, based on the
applicable [subset from compiler-rt][313].

For fuzzers written using the framework, the framework will adopt the same
approach as currently supported by the GN fuzzer templates: When building
fuzzers in an *uninstrumented* build, the engine will be replaced by a test
driver that simply executes each input in the seed corpus. This mitigates
"bit-rot" by ensuring all fuzzers can build and run. It also acts as a
regression test, especially if fuzzer authors maintain their seed corpora by
adding inputs when fixing defects found by fuzzing.

## Documentation

The [fuzzing documentation tree][217] will need to be updated with specific
examples of using the new GN templates. Any other planned documentation changes
(e.g. code-labs, etc.) should reflect this framework as well.

## Drawbacks and alternatives

Potential drawbacks to the proposed approach include:

* Risk of performance degradation, mitigated by the implementation closely
  imitating performance-critical sections of highly-optimized fuzzers.
* Maintenance burden, offset by the savings of not needing to maintain
  awkward integrations, e.g. POSIX emulations.
* Coupling risk, e.g. the Test Runner Framework may change in a way that breaks
  this design in the future, or may not be able to because of this design. If
  this becomes a problem in the future, it could be addressed by incorporating
  more of `test_manager`'s functionality directly into `fuzz_manager`, e.g. have
  the latter create isolated test realms directly.

These drawbacks are not as consequential as those of other alternatives
that have been explored:

### Library fuzzing only with libFuzzer.

Sufficient Fuchsia support has been added to libFuzzer to build fuzzers with it
on Fuchsia. These have been successful in finding hundreds of bugs over the
last few years.

At the same time, they are limited to single processes structured as libraries.
Since components are the unit of executable software on Fuchsia, and components
communicate extensively through FIDL, this leaves a large and growing amount of
Fuchsia code "unfuzzable" by this approach.

<br>![Conventional libFuzzer][405]<br>

### In-process FIDL fuzzing.

Projects such as Chrome have tried to address RPC fuzzing by running client and
server threads in a single process. This requires modifying both and client and
server to run in a new, non-standard configuration. This can be reusable between
services, but tends towards inflexible assumptions about component lifecycles
and/or per language-binding re-implementations.

More fundamentally, it becomes increasingly difficult to fuzz the *closure* of
interacting components. Many components have a non-trivial topology. To either
run or mock the entire closure quickly becomes unsustainable in terms of
complexity, overhead, and performance.

This approach is [already available][219] on Fuchsia, but has not seen
widespread adoption due at least in part to these limitations.

### Single-service FIDL fuzzing.

An initial attempt at designing a cross-process FIDL fuzzing framework
considered a single client and service. In this design, libFuzzer was linked
against the *service*, and the client was maintained as a simple proxy. By
retaining the FIDL interface between the client and server, it could keep the
target in a more typical configuration, allowing for more flexible service
lifecycles and less code needing to be reimplemented.

However, it does not address the problem of fuzzing component closures, and
therefore provides very limited benefit over in-process FIDL fuzzing.

### LibFuzzer with support for cross-process fuzzing.

As a general principle, reusing code has several advantages over reimplementing
it: the code is typically more "mature", with better performance and fewer bugs,
and has a lower and shared maintenance cost. For these reasons, another prior
attempt sought to extend libFuzzer rather than design and implement a new
fuzzing framework. A new compiler runtime, `clang_rt.fuzzer-remote.a`, would act
as the remote library above, while libFuzzer itself could be used as the engine.
Both of these compiler runtimes would use a pair of OS-specific IPC transport
libraries to proxy method calls to the other process.

In coordination with libFuzzer's maintainers, a series of changes implemented
both runtimes and published them for [review][322]. Additionally,
implementations of the IPC transport libraries were developed for both Linux and
Fuchsia. The maintainers explicitly requested Linux support to allow for
continuous testing, and it was again sent for [review][323].

* On Linux, the shared memory was created as an anonymously mapped file, i.e.
  via `memfd_create`, and the signals were simply messages passed via Unix
  domain sockets. These sockets were also used to transfer the shared memory
  file descriptors, i.e. via `sendmsg` and `recvmsg`.
* On Fuchsia, the shared memory was implemented using VMOs, the signals via
  eventpairs, and the exchange via FIDL messages in a manner similar to the
  design in this proposal.

Unfortunately, during extended review, this approach became infeasible not for
technical reasons but for process ones: Over time, the libFuzzer maintainers
became increasingly concerned at the scope of the necessary changes required to
make libFuzzer act in a way it was not originally designed for. Eventually, the
team decided to defer landing the proposed changes indefinitely.

### AFL

LibFuzzer is by no means the only fuzzing framework. Some, such as [AFL][309],
were explicitly designed to be cross-process from the start. However, there are
a few reasons AFL would require more investment than might otherwise be assumed:

* AFL assumes it is fuzzing a single process, so it still faces the closure
  problem.
* AFL makes heavy use of certain Linux and/or POSIX features for feedback and
  error detection. These include POSIX signals, but even more significantly,
  considerable use of the `/proc` filesystem, for which there is (correctly) no
  analogue on Fuchsia.
* AFL uses a modified GCC to instrument the code, which is not part of Fuchsia's
  toolchain.

[AFLplusplus][305] is an improved fork of AFL maintained by a set of security
researchers and CTF competitors. It has excellent performance on
[FuzzBench][316], and has modularized AFL. Unfortunately, the
[first version][307] is deprecated, and the [second][306] is not ready yet (or
at least is not mature enough to force altering the design above). Still,
several pieces align with this proposal's design, and there are future
opportunities to integrate them to improve the framework's coverage, speed, or
both.

### AFL with qemu

Additionally, there have been a few projects that combine AFL with qemu:

* [afl-unicorn][308] combines AFL with [Unicorn][327], a project that exposes
  the CPU emulation core of qemu with a fairly clean interface. This allows
  fuzzing opaque binaries without source by collecting coverage feedback from
  the CPU emulation. It is not suitable for a component framework for a few
  reasons:
  * The integration with qemu's core CPU emulation is complex enough that
    Unicorn has decided to forgo following qemu development and is locked to
    v2.1.2 (compared with current version 6.0.0 of qemu). Code that expects
    more recent emulation features is unlikely to function correctly.
  * There is no significant need for opaque binary fuzzing. In fact, the design
    only requires the target code to be instrumented and linked against the
    remote library; LLVM byte code is sufficient to achieve this.
* [TriforceAFL][314] uses AFL on a complete, instrumented qemu instance. This
  again allows fuzzing opaque binaries without source by collecting coverage
  from qemu itself. It is not suitable for similar reasons as afl-unicorn:
  * Again, there is no significant need for opaque binary fuzzing.
  * Additionally, since the coverage collected is of the entire instance,
    fuzzing with TriforceAFL tends to be very noisy, especially with many
    components running. It typically is only useful for fuzzing extremely
    constrained configurations, such as a USB driver immediately after booting.
