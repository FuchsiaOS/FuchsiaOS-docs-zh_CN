# Get involved with Fuchsia

This document describes the different ways you can get involved
and stay informed about Fuchsia.

## Review the Fuchsia roadmap

The Fuchsia project prioritizes features and enhancements that support our
development community. Read the [Fuchsia roadmap](/contribute/roadmap/index.md)
to get a high-level understanding of the various projects being considered
within Fuchsia.

## Understand the Request for Comments (RFC) process

The Requests for Comments (RFC) process is intended to provide a consistent and
transparent path for making project-wide technical decisions.

RFCs are documents that inform and build on the technical direction of the
Fuchsia project. RFCs can be proposed by anyone in the community. Using an RFC,
a Fuchsia community member can submit an idea or technical concept for broader
review or consideration. For more information, see [Fuchsia RFCs](/contribute/governance/rfcs).

### Review completed RFCs

To see a complete list of accepted and rejected RFC proposals, see [Accepted proposals](/contribute/governance/rfcs#accepted)
and [Rejected proposals](/contribute/governance/rfcs#rejected).

### Track ongoing RFCs

To stay up-to-date with RFCs that are still in progress, you can bookmark this [saved search](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/q/dir:docs/contribute/governance/rfcs+is:open)
that lists any open Gerrit change in the `rfcs` directory.

### Create an RFC

If you want to create a proposal that you want the Fuchsia Eng Council to
review, see [Creating an RFC.](/contribute/governance/rfcs/create_rfc.md)

## Join a discussion group

In Monorail, the `GoodFirstBug` label exists. This label signals to potential
contributors that a particular bug could be a great entry point in terms of
contributions, since that particular bug does not require extensive
experience/knowledge with the Fuchsia project.
