# Get involved with Fuchsia

This document describes the different ways you can get involved
and stay informed about Fuchsia.

## Review the Fuchsia roadmap

The Fuchsia project prioritizes features and enhancements that support our
development community. Read the [Fuchsia roadmap](/docs/contribute/roadmap/index.md)
to get a high-level understanding of the various projects being considered
within Fuchsia.

## Understand the Request for Comments (RFC) process

The Requests for Comments (RFC) process is intended to provide a consistent and
transparent path for making project-wide technical decisions.

RFCs are documents that inform and build on the technical direction of the
Fuchsia project. RFCs can be proposed by anyone in the community. Using an RFC,
a Fuchsia community member can submit an idea or technical concept for broader
review or consideration. For more information, see [Fuchsia RFCs](/docs/contribute/governance/rfcs).

### Review completed RFCs

To see a complete list of accepted and rejected RFC proposals, see [Accepted proposals](/docs/contribute/governance/rfcs#accepted)
and [Rejected proposals](/docs/contribute/governance/rfcs#rejected).

### Track ongoing RFCs

To stay up-to-date with RFCs that are still in progress, you can bookmark this [saved search](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/q/dir:docs/contribute/governance/rfcs+is:open)
that lists any open Gerrit change in the `rfcs` directory.

### Create an RFC

If you want to create a proposal that you want the Fuchsia Eng Council to
review, see [Creating an RFC.](/docs/contribute/governance/rfcs/create_rfc.md)

## Join a mailing list

Stay informed about the Fuchsia project by joining an email list through
Google Groups.

For more information,
see [Mailing lists](/docs/contribute/community/mailing-lists.md).

## Join our Discord server

Connect and chat with Fuchsia contributors in the Fuchsia Discord community.

Join the [Fuchsia Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/pjfYkmbq69){: .external}.

## Contribute code

The Fuchsia project encourages well-tested, high-quality contributions from
anyone who wants to contribute to Fuchsia, not just from Googlers.

To learn more about how to contribute a code change to Fuchsia,
see [Contribute changes](/docs/development/source_code/contribute_changes.md).

In Monorail, the `GoodFirstBug` label exists. This label signals to potential
contributors that a particular bug could be a great entry point in terms of
contributions, since that particular bug does not require extensive
experience/knowledge with the Fuchsia project.

To view the current list of bugs with the `GoodFirstBug` label, go to the
[Good First Bug List](https://bugs.fuchsia.dev/p/fuchsia/issues/list?q=label%3AGoodFirstBug).
