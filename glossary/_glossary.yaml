  for a system is the binary-level interface to the system. Typically you don't
  write software that uses the system ABI directly. Instead, you write software
  against the system API. When the software is compiled, the binary artifact
  created by the compiler interfaces with the system through the ABI.
  Changes to the system ABI may require you to recompile your source code to
  account for the changes in the ABI."

  <p>The term slot is used to refer to a set of partitions that update together.
  If an update fails, the partitions fall back together. This works because there are two copies
  of each partition on disk. By convention, the slots used for normal updates are denoted A and B,
  and the corresponding partitions are labeled with a suffix of \"_a\" or \"_b\".
  The slot used for recovery is denoted R which is chosen when neither A nor B is bootable.</p>"
